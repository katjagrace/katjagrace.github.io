My boyfriend and I cooperated to put water in our house's water boiling machine. When we had filled it up, I pointed out that we had spilled some water on the power hole at the back. He promptly put the power plug into it anyway, and said 'see, it's fine'.

It seems potentially not fine to me because:
- I have been told growing up that mixing water and power is bad
- I think I understand the mechanisms in a broad-brush fashion: a) if the water is touching a live wire and also you, then you might get electrocuted, and b) if the water connects a live wire in the socket to something else, it can start a fire. (The details of that one are hazier to me.)

It seems to me that I'm being overly 'anxious', and my boyfriend and those like him are correct in their level of concern. However how he achieves this seems mysterious. If your hypothesis is that a thing has a one in a hundred chance of killing you, then doing it once and not dying is basically no evidence against this. In my experience, if you try to talk to someone about the object level thing, they will try to brush it off in a way that suggests they neither have a model nor think that having a model is the way to do such things.
