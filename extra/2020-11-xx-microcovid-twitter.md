I'm concerned that people planning to celebrate Thanksgiving in a risky way are not informed about the scale of the risk, since I see them responding to the abstract idea of risk--noting for instance that one shouldn't live one's life in fear, or that traveling often involves risks--rather than the quantitative level of risk involved.

These are true and good points about some levels of risk——for instance, arguably that of driving a car a hundred miles (about one in a million risk of death), or of eating food that your semi-competent brother made——but nobody would say them about e.g. betting everyone in their family's health on the roll of a six sided dice. That would be a thanksgiving to skip.

Yet for instance if you live in Madison, Wisconsin and spend eight hours over thanksgiving inside with six other normal people from different households, each person would have around a 20% chance of getting covid from the evening, according to microcovid.org.

If you are xxx, I recommend checking exactly what risk you are taking at microcovid.org, and checking that they make sense to you. The results have sometimes been pretty surprising to me.

(Whatever your views on the appropriateness of governments telling you what risks you can take, you want to make your own choices well—-if you kill yourself whenever the government tells you not to, it gives the government too much power.)

I'm concerned that many people are making decisions about covid risks over thanksgiving with very little quantitative idea of how much risk they are taking on.

I see people discussing the abstract idea of risk--noting for instance that one shouldn't live one's life in fear, or that traveling often involves risks--as if the level of risk is like driving your car hundreds of miles, or going hang gliding (<1 in 100,000 chance of death).

But for instance if you live in Madison, Wisconsin and spend eight hours over thanksgiving inside with six other normal people from different households, each person would have around a 20% chance of getting covid from the evening, according to microcovid.org. Then depending on their age, they would have about a 0.1 to 10% chance of death, so maybe a 1 in 500 chance of death per person, plus maybe one in fifty chance of being permanently disabled

I'm concerned that many people are making decisions about covid risks over thanksgiving with very little quantitative idea of how much risk is on the table for them. I see people talking as if this is similar to driving a long way to thanksgiving or going hang-gliding, rather than similar to licking someone with ebola, or injecting yourself with heroin.

engaging instead with the idea of 'risk' in the abstract, and questions like whether it is good to live in fear, or whether it is right for the government to ... For instance

I'm concerned that many people are making decisions about covid risks over thanksgiving with very little quantitative idea of how much risk they are taking on.

I recommend checking the estimates for your specific plans at microcovid.org. The results have sometimes been pretty surprising to me.

For instance if you live in Madison, Wisconsin and spend eight hours over thanksgiving inside near six other normal people from different households, each person is estimated to have around a 20% chance of getting covid from the event, according to microcovid.org D:
