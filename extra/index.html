      <h1>A day at the Park</h1>
      <h2>The first part</h2>
      <p>I've been freezing my eggs lately, in case having children seems like a good choice at at some point in the future, but not so soon that the resulting children have optimal genetic prospects. This was somewhat fraught overall, though I did become more comfortable with blithely injecting vials of stuff into my body. (By which I mean doing so not as non-blithely as one might expect for a person with some OCD tendencies and good eyesight who has been instructed to just tap a syringe until it doesn't have bubbles in it.)

      </p><p>The main complication caused by my being poorly suited to this kind of thing personality-wise was that in the checking that anesthesia was safe, I noticed that it didn't seem to be. In particular, it seemed reasonably likely to cause non-negligible cognitive damage.

      </p><p>In particular, it seems clear that a large fraction (10% plus?!) of older people undergoing operations with general anesthesia end up so mentally messed up months to years later that they get diagnosed with 'post-operative cognitive dysfunction'. Since this seems to be worsened by being older, almost nobody seems interested in checking whether it also happens to younger people at non-zero rate. And for whatever reason, I have also not come across much interest in checking whether a larger set of people have less than sharply debilitating cognitive decline.

      </p><p>My doctor and anesthetologist had these points to make:
      - This is an old people thing and I am not an old person
      - This doesn't even involve that much general anestheteic so its probably safe

      </p><p>I hoped to reassure

      The one study I found that did test younger people found that around 6% of them also suffered from enough cognitive decline to count as POCD in the study, but random controls not undergoing surgery also


       ——read, my inclination toward object level reasoning over trusting doctors who couldn't object level reason their way out around an object, and 'discomfort with uncertainty'——</p>
       <h2>The second part</h2>
     <p>I am on holiday, and yesterday traveled to the land of Minecraft for a number of hours. (Approximately the number where the marginal joy of playing Minecraft is equal to the marginal suffering of wondering if I should stop playing Minecraft.)

  </p><p>In case you haven’t played Minecraft, it goes like this: you appear in the middle of a vast natural landscape largely made of blocks of different substances, as well as some (distinctly blocky) non-block entities, such as pigs or levers. Each block is about half as big as you. As you walk, more world forms indefinitely at the horizon, in a variety of ‘biomes’—swooping mountains, flowered meadows, desert lakes, forested hills, apparently oceanic islands covered with giant mushrooms—each full of characteristic landforms and objects and plants and animals. You can ‘break’ stuff from the landscape and pick up the resulting object, keeping it in one of your thirty-six pockets, or something. You can transform stuff into a vast array of other stuff, by combining it in recipes or cooking it, for instance.

  </p><p>You might start a game by breaking the wood blocks from a tree with your hands, then you might transform some of it into a ‘crafting table’, allowing you to then transform more wood into a pickaxe. You might use that pickaxe to break rocks, which you can combine with some wood to make a better pickaxe. (You might also in the process be attacked by a hostile skeleton archer, and end up destroying him and picking up a bone and a couple of arrows). If there is a predefined point to the game, I am not aware of it (now that I think about it, I’m not sure how the makers could make something be the point by declaring it so, but I’ve also never seen how God could do that with the universe, and I will admit that someone appears to have at least convinced everyone that they have done it in chess).

  </p><p>Minecraft often seems to me to capture the essence of problems in my real life more than other games do. I have all these objects and space and I have to figure out how to usefully organize the objects in the space. I constantly think of things I should do and don’t know which ones to do first, or how to remember what they all are, and always feel like I should have a better mental schema for even knowing what the possible things are that I should maybe do. In the process of doing one thing, I am reminded of several other ones that I should imminently do. It is bed time way too often. I constantly forget to eat. If I’m doing a thing and its night time or I’m dying of starvation or something else to do comes up, it’s never clear if I should actually stop immediately. (When will I finish the thing? How will I remember?) Less importantly or intensely in real life than in Minecraft, I often suspect that I’ve been in this exact place many times before, and yet I can’t tell it from similar places. And I forget which direction is which every time I turn a corner.

  </p><p>Basically, I think Minecraft gets at something about organizing the information required to be an agent, given limited memory. As you walk around, you see a lot of things, and have a lot of options, such that at any given point, the relevant options are not just a set of salient paths ahead, as in a sophisticated choose your own adventure book. Most of the best courses of action are not physically represented in front of you, and can only be seen at all because of structures in your own mind constructed to keep them available.</p>

      <h1>Philz Coffee in the Castro</h1>
      <p>Mostly notes from a while ago, when I used to go to cafes.
      <ol>
        <li>They sell kouign-amann comparably delicious to the best I have had, and kouign-amann is among the best food I have had. The first time I had kouign-amann, my rapturous eating of it made for one of those situations where you and people in stopped traffic nearby mutually acknowledge the intense thing you are all observing.</li><li>They were playing Velvet Underground. Now they are playing Boys don’t cry, by the Cure. The woman at the table next to me exclaimed ‘I love this song’ when it came on. This is about the third time I have looked at my phone to see if its recognition software can help me name a song I had forgotten. (Four: Starman, David Bowie…five: For no-one, The Beatles.)</li>
        <li>While I was considering whether to write this post, someone started improvising a song, ‘Welcome to Philz’. Not a casual coffee-grinding mumble, but a passionate song with a full-arm-extending dance. He explained to some customers that now that they were at Philz their lives would not be the same, because for instance if they bought coffee from other places now, they would be amazed by how much better Philz coffee was.</li>
        <li>The same guy is later doing a kind of Macarena dance over the shoulders of another guy while they wait for a customer to use the card machine. The coffee is very good.</li>
        <li>All of my meetings with people behind the counter feel more than usual as if we are mutually aware of the significance and beauty of this meeting.
        </li>
        <li>The unisex bathroom is decorated with a leaping pink and purple unicorn.
        </li>
        <li>The wall shelves are a rainbow. Hanging from it is a rainbow flag. The ceiling is flying bisexual, transgender, bear, leather, and lipstick lesbian flags, if I identify them correctly. The fridge decorations include ‘everyone is gay’ and ‘Butts!’.
        </li>
        <li>A customer brought his pet dog in, and another table of customers cheered it on as it lay down for a treat.</li>
