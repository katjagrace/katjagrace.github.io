          A game of mattering</a><span class="post-meta"> Sep 22, 2022</span>
      </h3><p>When I have an overwhelming number of things to do, and insufficient native urge to do them, I often arrange them into a kind of game for myself. The nature and appeal of this game has been relatively stable for about a year, after many years of evolution, so this seems like a reasonable time to share it. I also play it when I just want to structure my day and am in the mood for it. I currently play something like two or three times a week.</p>

<h1 id="the-game">The game</h1>

<p>The basic idea is to lay out the tasks in time a bit like obstacles in a platformer or steps in Dance Dance Revolution, then race through the obstacle course grabbing them under consistently high-but-doable time pressure.</p>

<p>Here’s how to play:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Draw a grid with as many rows as there are remaining hours in your hoped for productive day, and ~3 columns. Each box stands for a particular ~20 minute period (I sometimes play with 15m or 30m periods.)</li>
  <li>Lay out the gameboard: break the stuff you want to do into appropriate units, henceforth ‘items’. An item should fit comfortably in the length of a box, and it should be easy enough to verify completion. (This can be achieved through house rules such as ‘do x a tiny bit = do it until I have a sense that an appropriate tiny bit has been done’ as long as you are happy applying them). Space items out a decent amount so that the whole course is clearly feasible. Include everything you want to do in the day, including nice or relaxing things, or break activities. Drinks, snacks, tiny bouts of exercise, looking at news sites for 5 minutes, etc. Design the track thoughtfully, with hard bouts followed by relief before the next hard bout.</li>
  <li>To play, start in the first box, then move through the boxes according to the time of day. The goal in playing is to collect as many items as you can, as you are forced along the track by the passage of time. You can collect an item by doing the task in or before you get to the box it is in. If it isn’t done by the end of the box, it gets left behind. However if you clear any box entirely, you get to move one item anywhere on the gameboard. So you can rescue something from the past, or rearrange the future to make it more feasible, or if everything is perfect, you can add an entirely new item somewhere.</li>
</ol>

        <a class="post-link" href="/2022/09/22/calibration.html">
          Calibration of a thousand predictions</a><span class="post-meta"> Sep 22, 2022</span>
      </h3><p>I’ve been making predictions in a spreadsheet for the last four years, and I just got to a thousand resolved predictions. Some observations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I’m shockingly well calibrated for things that mostly aren’t my own behavior<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Calibration curve for 630 resolved predictions in that class:</p>

    <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/i/katjasgrace/Calibration_for_no-special-context_forecasts_(mostly_excluding_much_own-behavior_prediction)(1).png" alt="calibration no context predictions" width="500" /></p>

    <p>The 80% category is abberantly bad—off by about 12%—but the average miscalibration of the 11 categories is &lt;3%.</p>

    <p>At definite risk of bragging, this seems wild to me. My experience of making these predictions is fairly well described as ‘pulling a number out of thin air’. But if you take all these conjured numbers, and look at the 45 of them that fell in the vicinity of 40%, then I implicitly predicted that 17.28 of those events would happen. And in fact 18 of them happened. WTF? Why wasn’t it eight of them or thirty-five of them? And that was the fifth most accurate bucket. For predictions in the vicinity of 70%, I was off by 0.15%—I said 54.88 of those 80 things would happen, and in fact 55 of them happened.</p>

    <p>Possibly people overall are just better calibrated than I thought. I had some remembered view that people’s asserted 90% confidence intervals were really 50% confidence intervals or something, but I can’t immediately find such evidence now, and I can find various graphs of <a href="https://predictionbook.com/predictions">groups</a> of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Color-online-Calibration-Curves-Conditional-on-When-in-the-Questions-Life-the_fig1_320911494">people</a> <a href="https://goodjudgment.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Superforecasters-A-Decade-of-Stochastic-Dominance.pdf">being</a> on average fairly calibrated. And the <a href="https://predictionbook.com/users/Baeboo">handful</a> <a href="https://predictionbook.com/users/Tapetum-Lucidum">of PredictionBook</a> <a href="https://predictionbook.com/users/gwern">users</a> <a href="https://predictionbook.com/users/JoshuaZ">I could</a> <a href="https://predictionbook.com/users/brunoparga">find</a> with more than a thousand predictions are not hugely worse.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Except maybe more like art—do you know that feeling where you look at the sketch, and tilt your head from side to side, and say ‘no, a little bit more… just there….mmm…yes…’? It’s like that: ‘27%…no, a little more, 29%? No, 33%. 33%, yes.’ Except honestly it’s more ridiculous than that, because my brain often seems to have views about which particular digits should be involved. So it’s like, ‘23%…no, but mmm 3…33%, yes.’ I am generally in favor of question decomposition and outside views and all that, but that’s not what I’m doing here. I might have been sometimes, but these are usually fast intuitive judgments iirc. So imagine if you just sort of artistically made up numbers like that for years, with no introspective assurance that they were particularly good, and then they actually matched what happened! WTF? What magic is this? Also, aren’t humans basically guaranteed to give 90% confidence intervals that should have been 50% confidence intervals or something? Did you accidentally sell your soul to the devil for this on some occasion that you have conveniently forgotten about?</p>

<p>Or more precisely: say 45 of those made up numbers fall between 35% and 45%, and those ones average 38.41%. Which is to say, I predicted that 17.28 of events in that bucket would happen, and then in fact 18 (40%) of them happened. And this example isn’t even the closest.</p>

<p>One might object to this being interesting by noting that calibration isn’t hard in principle. For instance, if you want to be well calibrated, you can always make predictions about dice rolls, or otherwise strategize to coax predictably distributed randomness into right sized boxes (e.g. assign your statements randomly to P or -P and always predict 50% on P to be calibrated at 50%, and only make 75% predictions on statements of the form ‘P or Q’, etc). I don’t think that’s relevant here, because I didn’t do anything like that. For instance, I didn’t (that I recall) choose a proposition to predict on the basis that it would be easier to be calibrated on it. The closest things I do are try to adjust for my known miscalibration (e.g. if I want to say 80% on a thing, maybe I should say 70% if that is empirically what it has meant when I’ve said 80% before) and considering the opposites of statements (e.g. if I want to say 50% on A, check whether I really think 50% on not-A also). These seem like above-board ways to improve one’s calibration, because they can be applied across the board in making predictions about other things, and so represent genuine better calibration.</p>

          Self-conscious travel shots and mindless wildness</a><span class="post-meta"> Sep 22, 2022</span>
      </h3><p>Sometimes I have an urge to photograph things. I usually don’t, because the desire feels ill-motivated—I want to do it to show people, and that seems wrong somehow. It’s not about that usual modern sin: overstating my life for social media credit. It’s more that as I compose a photograph, I am purportedly framing an excerpt from my life, but the life I am showing is not one that I am living. Unless the story I am showing is that on this impeccable French morning, say, I was out there thinking about how to best display said morning to far away social media observers. And photographs of the photographer photographing feel trite, even if it is just metaphorical, so that is never the story that I want to tell.</p>

<p>Perhaps the implicit story could be lighter on details: just a woman looking out across the fields one time, who knows why. But still, I wasn’t looking across the fields in the object-level way that it feels like such an image evokes. For instance, I was’t basking in the surreal beauty of the hillsides. I was looking across the fields thinking about how to present them as if someone were looking at them ‘for real’.</p>

<p>(How often does anyone look across fields without it being partly about composing an imaginary shot for the imaginary people in their head? Is the dearth of that just me? I can’t even tell how often I do it, but not none.)</p>

<p>A different problem with travel photography is that I am nominally taking these photographs ‘for’ someone else, and yet I usually doubt that anyone else gets much out of them. In the stereotypical post-trip scene of the recently-returned traveler proffering a thick photo stack to a friend or relative, I worry that it is the latter doing the former the favor.</p>

<p>If I were to post a photograph, would anyone get straightforward pleasure from the scene, and not some meta-level benefit from being able to reinforce our friendship? Or is it just people thinking that other people will like their liking of an image all the way down?</p>

<p>I asked my friend about this, and he said that seeing people’s photos is one of the best parts of Facebook, and I realized that I also enjoy that often, and all of my above thoughts are obviously at least somewhat wrong. My stereotypical image might still be common, but it is far from ubiquitous. And this made me realize that it is also outdated: these days one is rarely handed a post-travel photography stack, or sat down for a slide show. Instead, people put photos on social media, which entirely changes the dynamic. Nobody is under almost any pressure to look at anything that they don’t want to, so one can photograph freely in the knowledge that at least one isn’t boring anyone, and if anyone looks, there is a non-negligible chance that they actually like it.</p>

<p>With this new understanding in mind, I present not my travel photography, but the pictures I especially wanted to share with at least one particular reader, from a journey into one of my favorite subreddits, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/">Nature is Fucking Lit</a>. These also don’t have the first issue, because whatever motivations I might have for sharing the pictures, they are not the ones with which they were taken.</p>

      </h3><p>I recently talked to Michael Trazzi for his podcast, The Inside View. It just came out, so if that’s a conversation you want to sit in on, do so <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSw3UVDZge0">here</a> [ETA: or read it <a href="https://theinsideview.ai/katja">here</a>].</p>

<p>The main topics were the <a href="https://aiimpacts.org/what-do-ml-researchers-think-about-ai-in-2022/">survey of ML folk</a> I recently ran, and my thoughts on moving more slowly on potentially world-threatening AI research (which is to say, AI research in general, <a href="https://aiimpacts.org/what-do-ml-researchers-think-about-ai-in-2022/">according to</a> the median surveyed ML researcher…). I also bet him a thousand dollars to his hundred that AI would not make blogging way more efficient in two years, if I recall. (I forget the exact terms, and there’s no way I’m listening to myself talk for that long to find out. If anyone else learns, I’m curious what I agreed to.)</p>

<p>For completeness of podcast reporting: I forgot to mention that <a href="https://axrp.net/episode/2021/07/23/episode-10-ais-future-and-dangers-katja-grace.html">I also talked to Daniel Filan on AXRP</a>, like a year ago.

  <li>If you write a question that seems clear, there’s an unbelievably high chance that any given reader will misunderstand it. (Possibly this applies to things that aren’t survey questions also, but that’s a problem for another time.)</li>
  <li>A better way to find out if your questions are clear is to repeatedly take a single individual person, and sit down with them, and ask them to take your survey while narrating the process: reading the questions aloud, telling you what they think the question is asking, explaining their thought process in answering it. If you do this repeatedly with different people until some are not confused at all, the questions are probably clear.</li>
  <li>If you ask people very similar questions in different sounding ways, you can get very different answers (possibly related to the above, though that’s not obviously the main thing going on).</li>

I took up <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26154406-the-passenger">this book</a> looking for a page-turner. It was, but hours before the end I thought its main contribution to my mental life would be the visceral knowledge that page-turners can be undelicious. It felt cold, and getting into its world felt bad. The protagonist slunk around dark and uncomfortable places, killing people, scheming harshly, perceiving low beams as dangers to the heads of tall men, and that sort of thing. With some amount of fretting about what she was becoming. I wanted to turn the pages, but I also kind of wanted it to end, and for me to read something more squarely enjoyable next time.

  <li>What are you looking forward to this week?</li>
  <li>What do you think of as the most important thing going on in the world right now?</li>
  <li>If you had a spare half hour right now, what would you do with it?</li>
  <li>What is something you changed your mind about recently?</li>
  <li>What in life is more important than other people realize?</li>
  <li>If someone gave you $5 right now, what would you do with it?</li>
  <li>Who is someone you think of as a hero?</li>
  <li>Are you paying attention to the US election?</li>
  <li>What was the biggest news story this year?</li>
</ol>

<p><br />
I don’t recall any notable constraints other than the location requirement, but I barely remember doing this.</p>

          Podcast: with Spencer Greenberg on groupstruckness and boundedness</a><span class="post-meta"> May 19, 2022</span>
      </h3><p>I <a href="https://clearerthinkingpodcast.com/episode/105">talked to Spencer Greenberg</a> a little while ago for his podcast <a href="https://clearerthinkingpodcast.com/">Clearer Thinking</a>. The recording is out today. According to his website we discussed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What does it mean to be “groupstruck”? How does groupstruck-ness differ from the bystander effect, normalcy bias, and other related cognitive biases? How do we break people out of being groupstruck? What does it mean to be a “bounded” person? How can we build up better decision-making heuristics? What sorts of decisions do people usually not quantify but should (and vice versa)? How can we make rational relationship decisions without coming across as “calculating” or cold? How does anthropic reasoning affect our hypotheses about the nature of the universe and life within it (i.e., the Fermi paradox, the simulation hypothesis, etc.)?</p>
</blockquote>

Originally I had a file index.markdown, which I replaced with this one in order to try to get pagination to work.
I also added two loops to a mostly empty page for that.-->
