        <!-- <span class="post-meta">Nov 27, 2021</span> --><p>Sometimes while holidaying, I find myself wanting to photograph things. I usually don’t, because the desire feels ill-motivated—I want to do it to show people, and it feels wrong. As I compose the photograph, I am composing an excerpt from my life, to be seen. Which isn’t obviously wrong—I don’t think for instance that it is that usual modern sin: overstating my life for social media credit. It’s more that the life I am composing a scene from is not one that I am living, unless the story is for instance that on this impeccable French morning, say, I was thinking about how to best display that morning into a scene for the audience. And photographs of the photographer photographing feel trite, even if it is just metaphorical, so that is never the story that I want to tell. Perhaps the implicit story could be lighter on details: it is just a story of a woman looking out across the fields one time. But still, I wasn’t looking across the fields in the object-level way that it feels like such an image evokes. For instance, I was’t basking in the surreal beauty of the hillsides. I was looking across the fields thinking about how to present them as if someone were looking at them ‘for real’.</p>

<p>(How often does anyone look across fields without it being partly about composing an imaginary shot for the imaginary people in their head? Is that just me? I can’t even tell how often I do it, but I think at least more if I have my camera out.)</p>

<p>A different problem with travel photography is that I am nominally taking these photographs ‘for’ someone else, and yet I doubt that anyone else gets much out of them. In the stereotypical post-trip scene of the recently-returned traveler proffering a thick Kodak envelope xxx to a friend or relative, I worry that it is the latter doing the former the favor.</p>

<p>If I were to post a photograph, would anyone get straightforward pleasure from the scene, and not some meta-level benefit from being able to reinforce our friendship? Or is it just people thinking that other people will like their liking of an image all the way down?</p>

<p>I asked my friend about this, and he said that seeing people’s photos is one of the best parts of Facebook, and I realized that I also enjoy that often, and all of my above thoughts are obviously at least somewhat wrong. My stereotypical image might still be common, but it is far from ubiquitous. And this made me realize that it is also outdated: these days one is rarely handed a post-travel photography stack, or sat down for a slide show. Instead, people put photos on Facebook, which entirely changes the dynamic. Nobody is under almost any pressure to look at anything that they don’t want to, so one can photograph freely in the knowledge that at least one isn’t boring anyone, and if they look, there is a non-negligible chance that they actually like it.</p>

<p>With this new understanding in mind, I present not my travel photography, but the pictures I especially wanted to share with at least one particular reader, from a recent journey into one of my favorite subreddits, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/">Nature is Fucking Lit</a>. These also don’t have the first issue, because whatever motivations I might have for sharing the pictures, they are not the ones with which they were composed.</p>

<p><em>[Content warning: death in fires, death in machine apocalypse]</em></p>

<h2 id="no-fire-alarms-for-agi">‘No fire alarms for AGI’</h2>

<p>Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote that ‘<a href="https://intelligence.org/2017/10/13/fire-alarm/">there’s no fire alarm for Artificial General Intelligence</a>’, by which I think he meant: ‘there will be no future AI development that proves that artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a problem clearly enough that the world gets common knowledge (i.e. everyone knows that everyone knows, etc) that freaking out about AGI is socially acceptable instead of embarrassing.’</p>

<p>He calls this kind of event a ‘fire alarm’ because he posits that this is how fire alarms work: rather than alerting you to a fire, they primarily help by making it common knowledge that it has become socially acceptable to act on the potential fire.</p>

<p>He supports this view with a great 1968 study by Darley and Latané, in which they found that if you pipe a white plume of ‘smoke’ through a vent into a room where participants fill out surveys, a lone participant will quickly leave to report it, whereas a group of three (innocent) participants will tend to sit by in the haze for much longer[^1].</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP22DpYYh8">Here’s</a> a video of a rerun[^2] of part of this experiment, if you want to see what people look like while they try to negotiate the dual dangers of fire and social awkwardness.</p>

        <!-- <span class="post-meta">Jun 6, 2021</span> --><p>I’m on holiday. A basic issue with holidays is that it feels more satisfying and meaningful to do purposeful things, but for a thing to actually serve a purpose, it often needs to pass a higher bar than a less purposeful thing does. In particular, you often have to finish a thing and do it well in order for it to achieve its purpose. And finishing things well is generally harder and less fun than starting them, and so in other ways contrary to holidaying.</p>

        </h3>
        <!-- <span class="post-meta">Mar 26, 2021</span> --><p><em><em>Crossposted from <a href="https://aiimpacts.org/">AI Impacts</a></em></em></p>

<p><em>[Epistemic status: my current view, but I haven’t read all the stuff on this topic even in the LessWrong community, let alone more broadly.]</em></p>

<p>There is a line of thought that says that advanced AI will tend to be ‘goal-directed’—that is, consistently doing whatever makes certain favored outcomes more likely—and that this is to do with the ‘coherence arguments’. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NxF5G6CJiof6cemTw/coherence-arguments-do-not-imply-goal-directed-behavior">Rohin Shah</a>, and probably others<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> , have argued against this. I want to argue against them.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The old argument for coherence implying (worrisome) goal-directedness</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>I’d reconstruct the original argument that Rohin is arguing against as something like this (making no claim about my own beliefs here):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>‘Whatever things you care about, you are best off assigning consistent numerical values to them and maximizing the expected sum of those values’</strong> <br /> ‘Coherence arguments’<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> mean that if you don’t maximize ‘expected utility’ (EU)—that is, if you don’t make every choice in accordance with what gets the highest average score, given consistent preferability scores that you assign to all outcomes—then you will make strictly worse choices by your own lights than if you followed some alternate EU-maximizing strategy (at least in some situations, though they may not arise). For instance, you’ll be vulnerable to ‘<a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100205601">money-pumping</a>’—being predictably parted from your money for nothing.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>‘Advanced AI will tend to do better things instead of worse things, by its own lights’</strong> <br />Advanced AI will tend to avoid options that are predictably strictly worse by its own lights, due to being highly optimized for making good choices (by some combination of external processes that produced it, its own efforts, and the selection pressure acting on its existence).</li>
  <li><strong>‘Therefore advanced AI will maximize EU, roughly’</strong> <br />Advanced AI will tend to be fairly coherent, at least to a level of approximation where becoming more coherent isn’t worth the cost.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">4</a></sup> Which will probably be fairly coherent (e.g. close enough to coherent that <a href="https://arbital.com/p/optimized_agent_appears_coherent/">humans can’t anticipate the inconsistencies</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>‘Maximizing EU is pretty much the same as being goal-directed’</strong><br />To maximize expected utility is to pursue the goal of that which you have assigned higher utility to.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">5</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>And since the point of all this is to argue that advanced AI might be hard to deal with, note that we can get to that conclusion with:</p>

<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>For instance, Richard Ngo agrees <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vphFJzK3mWA4PJKAg/coherent-behaviour-in-the-real-world-is-an-incoherent">here</a>, and Eric Drexler makes a related argument <a href="https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Reframing_Superintelligence_FHI-TR-2019-1.1-1.pdf">here</a>, section 6.4. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>Something something <a href="https://arbital.com/p/expected_utility_formalism/?l=7hh">This</a> has more on these arguments. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>I haven’t read all of this, and don’t yet see watertight versions of these arguments, but this is not the time I’m going to get into that. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:5" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>Assuming being ‘more coherent’ is meaningful and better than being ‘less coherent’, granting that one is not coherent, which sounds plausible, but which I haven’t got into. One argument against is that if you are incoherent at all, then it looks to me like you can logically evaluate any bundle of things at any price. Which would seem to make all incoherences identical—much like how all logical contradictions equivalently lead to every belief. However this seems unlikely to predict well how creatures behave in practice if they have an incoherent preferences. <a href="#fnref:5" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:6" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>This isn’t quite right, since ‘goal’ suggests one outcome that is being pursued ahead of all others, whereas EU-maximizing implies that all possible outcomes have an ordering, and you care about getting higher ones in general, not just the top one above all others, but this doesn’t seem like a particularly relevant distinction here. <a href="#fnref:6" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

        <!-- <span class="post-meta">Mar 9, 2021</span> --><p>Among people sheltering from covid, I think there is a common thought that being stuck in your home for a year begets a certain sameyness, that it will be nice to be done with.</p>

<p>It’s interesting to me to remember that big chunk of the variety that is missing in life comes from regular encounters with other people, and their mind-blowing tendencies to do and think differently to me, and jump to different conclusions, and not even know what I’m talking about when I mention the most basic of basic assumptions.</p>

<p>And to remember that many of those people are stuck in similar houses, similarly wishing for variety, but being somewhat tired of a whole different set of behaviors and thoughts and framings and assumptions.</p>

<p>Which means that the variety is not fully out of safe reach in the way that, say, a big lick-a-stranger party might be. At least some of it is just informationally inaccessible, like finding the correct answer to a hard math problem. If I could somehow spend a day living like a person stuck in their house across the street lives, I would see all kinds of new things. My home itself—especially with its connection to the internet and Amazon—is capable of vastly more variety than I typically see.</p>

<p>So 1) and 2) are both the observation, “Open Phil has not scaled up its money-moving in recent years”.</p>

<p>I’m confused about how this observation seems suggestive about the size of the EA community. Open Phil is not a community small-donations collector. You can’t even donate to Open Phil. It is mainly moving Good Ventures’ money, i.e. the money of a single couple: Dustin Moskovitz and Cari Tuna.</p>

        </h3>
        <!-- <span class="post-meta">Mar 7, 2021</span> --><p>To me, going to bed often feels more like a tiresome deprivation from life than a welcome rest, or a painless detour through oblivion to morning. When I lack patience for it, I like to think about math puzzles. Other purposeful lines of thought keep me awake or lose me, but math leads me happily into a world of abstraction, from which the trip to dreamland comes naturally.</p>

<p>(It doesn’t always work. Once I was still awake after seemingly solving two Putnam problems, which is about as well as I did in the actual Putnam contest.)</p>

<p>A good puzzle for this purpose should be easy to play with in one’s head. For me, that means it should be amenable to simple visualization, and shouldn’t have the kind of description you have to look at multiple times. A handful of blobs is a great subject matter; an infinite arrangement of algebra is not.</p>

<p>Recently I’ve been going to sleep thinking about the following puzzle. I got several nights of agreeable sleep out of it, but now I think I have a good solution, which I’ll probably post in future.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose that you have 1 kg of red clay that is 100 degrees and 1 kg of blue clay that is 0 degrees. You can divide and recombine clay freely. If two pieces of clay come into contact, temperature immediately equilibrates—if you put the 1kg of red clay next to 0.5 kg of blue clay, all the clay will immediately become 66 degrees. Other than that the temperature of the clay doesn’t change (i.e. no exchange with air or your hands, no radiation, etc.). Your goal is to end up with all of the blue clay in a single clump that is as hot as possible. How hot can you make it? (Equivalently: how cold can you make the red clay?)</p>

<p>I was interested in Julia’s question of whether she was just using different words to those who for instance would say that incest or consensual cannibalism are ‘morally wrong’.</p>

<p>She explained that her earlier guest, Michael Sandel, had asked whether she didn’t ‘cringe’ at the thought of consensual cannibalism, as if he thought that was equivalent to finding it immoral. Julia thought she could personally cringe without morally condemning a thing. She had read Megan McArdle similarly observing that ‘liberals’ claim that incest is moral, but meanwhile wouldn’t befriend someone who practices it, so do in fact morally object after all</p>

<p>In the September of 1975, Oliver (‘Billy’) Sipple was an ex-marine of thirty-three, injured in Vietnam and living in San Francisco. He was in and out of the veteran’s hospital, six years into civilian life.</p>

<p>One afternoon, he stood in a crowd of thousands of people to see the visiting President Gerald Ford leave a San Francisco hotel from across the street. Ford stopped to wave. Suddenly, a shot sounded, and Oliver saw a woman nearby adjusting the aim of her revolver. He lunged and grabbed her arm, sending the second bullet into the hotel, injuring a man inside.</p>

<p>Oliver was thanked for saving the president, and celebrated as a hero by the media. A heroic veteran.</p>

<p>Soon the media learned that he was in fact a heroic <em>gay</em> veteran.</p>

<p>It feels natural to me that sincere enthusiasms should be rare relative to criticism and half-heartedness. But I would have thought this was born of fairly basic features of the situation, and so wouldn’t change over time.</p>

<p>It seems clearly easier and less socially risky to be critical of things, or non-committal, than to stand for a positive vision. It is easier to produce a valid criticism than an idea immune to valid criticism (and easier again to say, ‘this is very simplistic - the situation is subtle’). And if an idea is criticized, the critic gets to seem sophisticated, while the holder of the idea gets to seem naïve. A criticism is smaller than a positive vision, so a critic is usually not staking their reputation on their criticism as much, or claiming that it is good, in the way that the enthusiast is.</p>

And thus it is possible to control the forces of outside perception even as they control you. Which can do a lot of the job of not caring what other people think.</p>

        <!-- <span class="post-meta">Feb 11, 2021</span> --><p>Someone more familiar with ecology recently noted to me that it used to be a popular view that nature was ‘in balance’ and had some equilibrium state, that it should be returned to. Whereas the new understanding is that there was never an equilibrium state. Natural systems are always changing. Another friend who works in natural management also recently told me that their role in the past might have been trying to restore things to their ‘natural state’, but now the goal was to prepare yourself for what your ecology was becoming. A brief Googling returns this National Geographic article by Tik Root, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/balance-of-nature-explained/"><em>The ‘balance of nature’ is an enduring concept. But it’s wrong.</em></a> along the same lines. In fairness, they seem to be arguing against both the idea that nature is in a balance so intense that you can easily disrupt it, and the idea that nature is in a balance so sturdy that it will correct anything you do to it, which sounds plausible. But they don’t say that ecosystems are probably in some kind of intermediately sturdy balance, in many dimensions at least. They say that nature is ‘in flux’ and that the notion of balance is a misconception.</p>

<p>It seems to me though that there is very often equilibrium in some dimensions, even in a system that is in motion in other dimensions, and that that balance can be very important to maintain.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>bicycle</li>
  <li>society with citizens with a variety of demeanors, undergoing broad social change</li>
  <li>human growing older, moving to Germany, and getting pregnant, while maintaining a narrow range of temperatures and blood concentrations of different chemicals</li>

  <li>
    <p>One day people will probably live much longer than they do now.<br /><br />Probably we will work out how to beat the diseases of aging, as we have many of the infectious diseases. Eventually dying at age 90 of heart disease will seem as much of a needless tragedy as dying of an infection at age 45 does to us now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One day we will probably be able to ‘freeze’ and usefully thaw organs like brains using vitrification.<br /><br />We can already do this with other organs. For instance <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2781097/">a rabbit kidney can apparently already be vitrified then warmed up and put back in a rabbit and work</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People can start to successfully evade the diseases of aging as soon as science reaches the freezing part of 2, even if it hasn’t got to the thawing part or to 1 yet. Because once you are vitrified, you can wait quite a long time for further developments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a decent chance that we are already at the freezing part of 2. For instance, <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/332074-cryonics-rabbit-brain-regenerated/">a defrosted vitrified rabbit brain apparently appeared to be in good order</a>, though I assume we don’t know how to reattach brains to rabbits, alas.</p>

I haven’t actually signed up for this, but I might, and if I thought there was a higher chance of me dying sooner, I would get around to figuring it out more urgently. So I thought I’d point it out to others older than me, who might want to think about it more promptly.</p>

        <!-- <span class="post-meta">Feb 4, 2021</span> --><p>Suppose you want to get in touch with your care for someone, or to feel empathy for them. One way is to imagine what it is like to be them, looking out of their eyes and feeling what they are feeling. For instance, if your friend did something frustrating, you might imagine the experience of choosing under pressure that might have led to it, and you might thereby feel warmth toward them and sympathy for their error.</p>

<p>But I think it is more common to do something else, kind of like imagining them from the outside, but such that their mental content is also somehow accessible.</p>

<p>On the other hand, ‘efficiency’ doesn’t mean anything about building explicit or quantitative machinery. It just means getting a lot of the desired output per input. So one might wonder why, if these explicit efforts would tend to make things worse for our actual goals, we would pursue efficiency in such ways, and continue to call that ‘efficiency’. For those who think quantitative pursuit of well-defined goals has been a bad strategy overall, shouldn’t ‘efficient daycare’ suggest a daycare where we have used our best intuitions for holistically improving the experience?</p>

It is associated with factories and killing and commercialization, and people who are no fun. Things are openly criticized for being oriented toward efficiency. Nobody hopes to give their children an efficient childhood or asks for an efficient Valentine’s day, unless they want to get it over with. I expect wariness in listeners at talk of efficient charity.</p>

<p>This intrigues me, because in what I take to be its explicit definition, ‘efficiency’ is almost the definition of goodness manifest. The efficiency of a process is the rate with which it turns what you have into what you want.</p>

<p>In my experience, atheists tend to focus on the empirical question of whether there is an all-powerful supernatural creature behind all that we observe. And yeah, there probably isn’t.</p>

<p>But having won that point, what does one make of the extreme popularity of religion? I think the usual answer given is something like ‘well, we used to be very ignorant and not have good explanations of natural phenomena, plus we tend to see agents in everything because our agent detection software is oversensitive’.</p>

<p>Which might explain the question ‘Why would people think a supernatural agent controls things?’. But what seems like only a corner of religion.</p>

<p>Another big part of religion—and a thing that also occurs outside religion—seems to be ‘spirituality’—a cluster of things I find hard to describe, but which seem pretty disconnected from explanatory questions of where trees came from or why the crops failed.</p>

        <!-- <span class="post-meta">Jan 25, 2021</span> --><p>My household previously made some highly uncertain estimates of the covid risk from bringing random objects that other people have recently been touching into our home, for instance salads and groceries an endless stream of Amazon packages. The official guidance is very vague, e.g. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html">“…not thought to be the main way the virus spreads”</a>. Our bad estimates were fairly low, so we decided to basically ignore it in our covid risk accounting, except for habitually taking some reasonable precautions.</p>

<p>Then the covid rates here increased by a factor of ten, so we decided it would be good to look at it again.</p>

<p>So today I tried to estimate this from <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/11/01/2020.10.27.20220905.full.pdf">this paper</a> (HT Ben Weinstein-Raun and Catherine Olsson) in which a group of researchers swabbed various door handles and trash cans and crosswalk buttons and the like in a small Massachusetts city and measured the covid RNA detectable on them.

<ol>

    <p>If you spend a lot of money on a nice cheese, wrapped up in some fancy foreign label, there is a good chance that it will languish sadly in the back of the fridge for months until someone notices that it is moldy and throws it away, or makes a last-ditch attempt to cut up the whole thing and compel the group to eat it. Maybe on the way there, someone will take a single slice of it once, and move it in a zip-loc bag, where it will remain until the end.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you spend a few dollars on a six-pack of generic single-serve cheese-cubes with nuts, they will fly from the fridge and you will be acknowledged for this triumph of shopping, and more such cheese will be needed by the next grocery order.</p>

<ul>
  <li>People spend increasing time alone over their whole lives, with the exception of roughly their twenties. This surprises me a bit because it seems like people like spending time with other people, and I would expect them to increasingly succeed at it with experience and time to acquire partners and families and friends.</li>
  <li>From 31 to 45, people spend more time with children<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> on average than they spend with any other category of person, including for instance partners and colleagues.</li>
  <li>You might think all this children time would be substituting for some partner time, but as the children time swoops downward by three quarters, partner time stays about the same.</li>
  <li>People are at a relationship-time-steady-state between about thirty and sixty. I imagine that many people start relationships in that time, so does that mean that they also stop them at about the same rate, or gradually reduce time with their partners at a rate matching others’ forming of new relationships? Are people radically less likely to start relationships after about thirty?</li>
  <li>People spend broadly decreasing time with every group except their partner over time, from some early peak for each trend—in the teenage years for friends and family, and in the 20s and 30s for colleagues and children. I wonder how many people just like being alone and with their partners more than most other options, and steadily optimize for that, once they have been sociable enough to find a partner in their early years.</li>
  <li>Coworker time peaks at age 25-30 and goes slowly downward before the retirement descent. Is that from people dropping out of the workforce? Earning themselves a nice private office? Some difference between junior and senior roles?</li>
  <li>People spend fairly consistent time with their friends after a decline from 18 to 40. Retirement doesn’t increase it. Spending three hours a day fewer with children doesn’t increase it. I guess those things go to solitude.</li>

<p>Like, if instead of everyone being more or less cautious over a year, we all agreed on single a two week period to hard quarantine. With plenty of warning, so that people had time to stock up on groceries and do anything important ahead of time. And with massive financial redistribution in advance, so that everyone could afford two weeks without work. And with some planning to equip the few essential-every-week-without-delay workers (e.g. nurses, people keeping the power on) with unsustainably excessive PPE.</p>

<p>This wouldn’t require less total risky activity. If we just managed to move all of the risky activity from one fortnight to the one before it, then that would destroy the virus (and everyone could do as many previously risky activities as they liked in the following fortnight!). It could be kind of like the Christmas week except twice as long and the government would pay most people to stay at home and watch movies or play games or whatever. Maybe the TV channels and celebrities could cooperate and try to put together an especially entertaining lineup.</p>

It basically claims that much of human effort is directed at being admitted to whatever the local in-group is, that this happens easily to people, and that it is a bad thing to be drawn in to.</p>

<p>Some quotes, though I also recommend reading the whole thing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the passage I have just read from Tolstoy, the young second lieutenant Boris Dubretskoi discovers that there exist in the army two different systems or hierarchies. The one is printed in some little red book and anyone can easily read it up. It also remains constant. A general is always superior to a colonel, and a colonel to a captain. The other is not printed anywhere. Nor is it even a formally organised secret society with officers and rules which you would be told after you had been admitted. You are never formally and explicitly admitted by anyone. You discover gradually, in almost indefinable ways, that it exists and that you are outside it; and then later, perhaps, that you are inside it.

        <!-- <span class="post-meta">Jan 20, 2021</span> --><p>A quote from Aldous Huxley that has stuck in my mind more than perhaps any other over the years:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We live together, we act on, and react to, one another; but always and in all circumstances we are by ourselves. The martyrs go hand in hand into the arena; they are crucified alone. Embraced, the lovers desperately try to fuse their insulated ecstasies into a single self-transcendence; in vain. By its very nature every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy in solitude. Sensations, feelings, insights, fancies—all these are private and, except through symbols and at second hand, incommunicable. We can pool information about experiences, but never the experiences themselves. From family to nation, every human group is a society of island universes.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I used to be fairly troubled by this kind of thought. These days I’m more inclined to think of memories of myself, my own writing from yesterday, my sense of a person in my arms, words vibrating my inner ears as light bounces between someone’s eyes and mine, words reaching me across the internet from a stranger, barely understandable lines from thousand year old pages, as more of a piece—physical communications between scattered consciousness. All interpreted with more or less insight and confidence and detail and sense of being an ‘experience’ and not just ‘information’, depending on the quality and nature of the message. But my ‘imagining’ of your mental state, and my ‘knowing’ of my own are both guesses. The sense that they are different is a pragmatic, superficial, quantitative one, not the symptom of a deep metaphysical separation.</p>

        <!-- <span class="post-meta">Jan 17, 2021</span> --><p>A question that I return to in life strategy is whether to lean heavily on ‘spending one’s weirdness points wisely’—otherwise put, cowering lonely behind a cardboard cutout of the most forgettable person while proffering optimized propaganda through carefully selected slots—or whether to offer the world a fuller view of oneself.</p>

<p>A few arguments as I see them:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hiding allows you to be strategic, showing anything that is good to show, hiding anything that is not. Surely that is better then than any alternative, that must involve showing things that are bad to show, or not showing things that are good to show?</li>
  <li>Not necessarily! People can tell which strategy you are using, and usually the things that are ‘bad to show’ are bad for <em>you</em> to show, but other people would be perfectly interested to see them. So it is less cooperative, and people may respond to that, which may on a longer term view be bad for you.</li>
  <li>Also, which strategy you are enacting overall, or what you are doing in the past or future, can change whether something is good or bad to share. For instance, maybe you have personal problems that it would be both nice to have in the open, and helpful for others to know that you also face. If you are usually open about things, mentioning these might be no big deal, and so worth it on net. Whereas if you tend to be private, then suddenly announcing a personal problem will seem like a bigger deal, so the costs might outweigh the benefits.</li>
  <li>There is something good about actually knowing other people - being part of a global intellectual society of real people, not of robotic fictions created by people. Being open contributes to this world being actual.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are intermediate options too, of course. Are there good principled ones?</p>

            Meditative thinking</a> <span class="post-meta"> Jan 15, 2021</span>
        </h3>
        <!-- <span class="post-meta">Jan 15, 2021</span> --><p>I got fairly into meditation in 2018. Not in a way where you do a huge amount of meditation, or seek guidance on how to do meditation well, or on whether what you are doing is meditation at all. I don’t think I even graduated from doing meditation largely in five minute bouts. I just really dug a set of mental things which seemed related to meditation. I was riding an ethos. I suppose meditation was a particularly namable point in the space, but not obviously the most exciting part of it, so I ended up being pretty excited about ‘meditation…?’ while not actually meditating that much.</p>

<p>I also remained so ignorant about meditation traditions and previous human meditation experience that you might doubt that I’m talking about the same thing. (I did talk to other people a little, and did about five guided meditations, which seemed like a different kind of thing anyway, but also very awesome.)</p>

<p>With that said, here’s a kind of meditation I made up. I call it, ‘meditative thinking’. In it, you do all the stuff you would usually do while meditating: be in a meditation-conducive position (I do lying on my back, which I hear is a bad idea, but it is very comfy); set a meditation timer with bells at the start and end (mine also makes water sounds between them, but this probably isn’t crucial); close your eyes; be aware of your breathing; then just go on being aware of stuff in a conspicuously conscious way. But before all this, choose a question to think about. And then, once meditating, think about the question. Maintain the same mental stance as you normally would meditating, insofar as that makes sense. Be aware of your breathing, and your awareness, and your thinking. If you stop thinking about the question, gently bring your awareness back to it.</p>

<p>I still find this good. Though it’s possible that it gets much of its benefit from being a ritualistic way to actually think about a question for five or ten minutes without reflexively opening Facebook because thinking doesn’t correspond to a tab or occupy one’s hands.</p>

An iPad turns Agricola from one of the slowest games that casual board gamers might still be bothered to play to something you can play a few quick rounds of over lunch. I downloaded some kind of poker app, and began. It was maybe 9pm, and I was maybe sitting on my bed, in maybe Berkeley. My memories are pretty unclear. The app was green I think, like some kind of casino table.</p>

        <!-- <span class="post-meta">Jan 9, 2021</span> --><p>I enjoyed James Somers <a href="https://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary">account</a> (HT <a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/12/19/thesauring.html#comment-5194868155">Liron Shapira</a>) of how Webster’s dictionary used to be much more beautiful than dictionaries today, for instance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“…Flashing differs from exploding or disploding in not being accompanied with a loud report. To glisten, or glister, is to shine with a soft and fitful luster, as eyes suffused with tears, or flowers wet with dew.”</em>
<br />
<br />
Did you see that last clause? “To shine with a soft and fitful luster, as eyes suffused with tears, or flowers wet with dew.” I’m not sure why you won’t find writing like that in dictionaries these days, but you won’t. Here is the modern equivalent of that sentence in the latest edition of the Merriam-Webster: “glisten applies to the soft sparkle from a wet or oily surface <glistening wet="" sidewalk="">.”
<br />
<br />
Who decided that the American public couldn’t handle “a soft and fitful luster”? I can’t help but think something has been lost. “A soft sparkle from a wet or oily surface” doesn’t just sound worse, it actually describes the phenomenon with less precision. In particular it misses the shimmeriness, the micro movement and action, “the fitful luster,” of, for example, an eye full of tears — which is by the way far more intense and interesting an image than “a wet sidewalk.”</glistening></p>

You come across them, and they urge you to do something, and present it in a certain way, and induce some inclination to do it. But film posters are totally different from films. If you like a film poster, you don’t have to try to see the film. There is no metaphysical connection between the beauty of a film poster and the correctness of you seeing the film. It’s some evidence, but you have other evidence, and you get to choose. A film poster can be genuinely the most beautiful film poster you’ve ever seen, without the film being a worthwhile use of two hours. That’s largely an orthogonal question. If you put up the poster on your wall and look at it lovingly every day, and never see the film, that doesn’t need to be disappointing—it might be the best choice, and you might be satisfied in choosing it.</p>

Each time I look at one, as well as marking it correct to the extent that I no longer feel bad about it, I briefly do a little bit to make it better. (Learn about the thing I’m embarrassed to not know about, practice the skill that I don’t have, think about whether it’s a real problem, etc). My sense is that one can often feel bad about something for a long time which one could alternatively make marked progress on in a very short time.</p>

At least some of the time, or for some parts of you, or in some aspects, or when your situation changes a bit. Especially if you contain multitudes.</p>

For instance, as well as thinking I have 19% Swedish ancestry, they now guess that it is primarily from Västra Götaland County. Which is in fact where my current Swedish relatives cluster. Their guesses in Ireland center on Cork, with Limerick and Tipperary next door 4th and 8th most likely (of 26 counties), and those two are where the few 17th-19th Century relatives I know about seem to have come from in Ireland, so that also seems pretty good.</p>

<p>Much as I believe all that stuff about one’s body being full of cells that contain genetic code that is shared by one’s relatives, and about historic movement and mixing of populations being low, it’s awesome to actually see someone take a fairly good guess at what part of what country your obscure relatives lived hundreds of years ago by examining your spit.</p>

        <!-- <span class="post-meta">Dec 5, 2020</span> --><p>When I think of humans being so smart due to ‘cultural accumulation’, I think of lots of tiny innovations in thought and technology being made by different people, and added to the interpersonal currents of culture that wash into each person’s brain, leaving a twenty year old in 2020 much better intellectually equipped than a 90 year old who spent their whole life thinking in 1200 AD.</p>

<p><strong>The Milkmaid, by Johannes Vermeer.</strong></p>

<p>I have had a soft spot for Vermeer, the 17th Century Dutch artist, ever since I was compelled to write about him in high school, and I especially like this painting. I think it’s a particularly good example of how his painting of textures makes them seem almost supernaturally pleasing. I wouldn’t usually think of myself as a huge fan of textures. But here—the seed encrusted bread looks so crisp and solid, I can imagine the sound of my hand knocking some seeds off as I pick it up, or the thud of the loaf if I tapped it.</p>

The point of all this was to not have the ever-present sense of a giant backlog of things I am supposed to deal with, of which mounds of non-given-up-on emails are one piece. (Another option would be to just give up on everything that was ever pending, but I’m not quite up for it.)</p>

<p>It is based on <a href="https://noiseinyourhead.com/">Reid Wilson’s</a> ideas, I think as described in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stopping-Noise-Your-Head-Overcome/dp/0757319068">his book</a>, though I haven’t read it and most of my understanding comes from my therapist, my friend who also does this, and a <a href="https://noiseinyourhead.com/free-video-series/">set of humorous videos on Reid Wilson’s website</a>.</p>

I suggested it this time because I often find it enlightening to hear an outside perspective on things that I do, and his in particular. And it seems rarer to hear about the details and tactics, versus very high level questions: I often know what projects another person thinks are good, but rarely know what they would do if they got an email asking to hang out from an acquaintance, or if they were feeling antsy, or how they would decide where to start on the project in question, or when to stop.</p>

A notable thing about it to me was that the humor seemed in such poor taste. Which made me wonder, was 1996 just culturally different? Slapstick humor includes an emaciated old man imprisoned in a cylindrical cage tumbling over and over while someone runs on top of it, before he escapes, only to accidentally fall into some stocks. Ha! During a song, romantic rivals are jovially represented as hanging in the gallows. Various jokes are made around two men being sentenced to hanging without trial or ability to speak (‘any last words? didn’t think so’). Maybe I’m wrong that this would all seem weird to current viewers, and instead I’m just out of touch.</p>

<p>When Bob’s car breaks down, he borrows Alice’s car. Driving it, he constantly has his foot on the accelerator, to no avail. The visceral slowness is encumbering and distracting. He spends more than an hour overcome with frustration, plus that extra five minutes driving.</p>

        <!-- <span class="post-meta">Nov 19, 2020</span> --><p>With covid-19, basically everyone in the world is facing a set of personal problems that they didn’t have before, but which have much in common with everyone else’s new problems. Most basically, how to go about life without catching a deadly or crippling disease. But also, how to make alternative activities workable, and how to thrive and be happy in this potentially oppressive circumstance.</p>

<p>With everyone thinking about what to do about similar problems, an interesting set of questions to me is where do ideas for ways to improve the situation come from, and how do they spread? That is, how do people learn about them? <a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/11/17/octobillionupling-effort.html">How much are people benefitting from other people’s thinking</a> about similar problems?</p>

<p>I’ve been extremely lucky in having a job that can continue fine from my house, living with a bunch of people I like who can also work from home, having started dating someone I already lived with in January, being in San Francisco, and having some spare money this year, so I’m not compelled to do anything very risky and thus my exact problems and solutions may differ from others’. Nonetheless, it seems good to share them.</p>

Like for me, if you can see the places where the floor and the walls meet, or if there is a clear path between the door and at least one reasonable place to be in a room, these are victories (bonus points if you don’t have to do any unusual jumping or balancing to follow the path). And other people have entire twelve-foot cubes full of immaculately placed objects.</p>

        <!-- <span class="post-meta">Nov 17, 2020</span> --><p>When basically everyone in the world faces the same problem, it is interesting if everyone does their own working out to solve it. Even if there isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer, you might think it would be massively more efficient to do a good job of answering once with some free variables.</p>

<p>For instance, my impression is that even before covid, basically everyone was sometimes possibly a bit sick and had to decide whether to go to an event, given that they might be contagious. The usual thing to do, I think, was to consider the question for a bit yourself (or not, depending on conscientiousness), and to maybe mention it to the host and try to guess how annoyed the other guests would be, and then to make a call. But this isn’t a highly personal question—if someone who knew more about infectious disease contagion than most people (which wouldn’t be hard) made a form to tell you what to do based on your symptoms and the number of people at the event, you would probably already be making a better choice, faster, than most people.</p>

        <!-- <span class="post-meta">Nov 12, 2020</span> --><p>I get migraines about once a week. They aren’t as bad as migraines are classically understood to be—in fact they always start out pretty mild—but they sometimes become terrible by the evening.</p>

<p>While there are always various things I could do to improve such situations, I have often failed to do them promptly. Which seems pretty weird, but I suppose I am not at my most energetic and mentally functional. Also, none of the interventions I know of actually resolve migraines instantaneously, so my sense that I should for instance take painkillers is more of an intellectual one than a felt urge. And I think suffering drains my interest in upholding vague intellectual senses that I should do things. Then even if I did remember, it’s a further effort to even recall what else might be good, let alone go and find the relevant objects.</p>

<p>I have improved this a fair bit with a retrospectively obvious innovation: the migraine basket.</p>

<p><em>‘Come roll in all the riches all around you</em>

<p>This suggests that wondering what everything is worth negates what is valuable about it, which is to say, makes it worth less to you. Is it true that looking out for value like this is self-undermining? It sounds plausible to me, but why?</p>

<p>I haven’t read all of the responses yet, but a notable feature of them so far is the extent to which people expected their own favorite candidate to win the presidency.

  <li>Is etymology deep? What do people get out of knowing the origins of words?</li>
  <li>What is going on in history, at a high level?</li>
  <li>Can history be understood at a high level, or to have a real understanding of ‘what’s going on’, do you need to know about the detailed circumstances in each case?</li>

  <li>These companies put vast optimization effort into manipulating you, to extract more attention</li>
  <li>This means your behavior and attention is probably very shaped by these forces (which you can perhaps confirm by noting your own readiness to scroll through stuff on your phone)</li>

        <!-- <span class="post-meta">Oct 20, 2020</span> --><p>People often tell me that they don’t like San Francisco, especially of late. It’s dirty, or depressing, or has the wrong vibe, or is full of people who think it is reasonable to ban straws, or is the epitome of some kind of sinister social failing. Which are all plausible complaints.</p>

<p>I’m reminded of this thought from <em><a href="http://www.leaderu.com/cyber/books/orthodoxy/ch5.html">Orthodoxy</a></em>, by G. K. Chesterton, which my boyfriend and I have been meanderingly reading in recent months:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let us suppose we are confronted with a desperate thing – say Pimlico. If we think what is really best for Pimlico we shall find the thread of thought leads to the throne or the mystic and the arbitrary. It is not enough for a man to disapprove of Pimlico: in that case he will merely cut his throat or move to Chelsea. Nor, certainly, is it enough for a man to approve of Pimlico: for then it will remain Pimlico, which would be awful. The only way out of it seems to be for somebody to love Pimlico: to love it with a transcendental tie and without any earthly reason. If there arose a man who loved Pimlico, then Pimlico would rise into ivory towers and golden pinnacles; Pimlico would attire herself as a woman does when she is loved. For decoration is not given to hide horrible things: but to decorate things already adorable. A mother does not give her child a blue bow because he is so ugly without it. A lover does not give a girl a necklace to hide her neck. If men loved Pimlico as mothers love children, arbitrarily, because it is theirs, Pimlico in a year or two might be fairer than Florence. Some readers will say that this is a mere fantasy. I answer that this is the actual history of mankind. This, as a fact, is how cities did grow great. Go back to the darkest roots of civilization and you will find them knotted round some sacred stone or encircling some sacred well. People first paid honour to a spot and afterwards gained glory for it. Men did not love Rome because she was great. She was great because they had loved her.</p>

<p>It’s not that American politics fails to be attention-grabbing. But a casserole falling on the floor is attention grabbing, and I wouldn’t say that I’m interested in falling casseroles. I do read about the political situation, but like a casserole-fall viewer, mostly with curiosity and responsive dismay, not with real intellectual engagement or fertile thinking. Why?</p>

        <!-- <span class="post-meta">Oct 18, 2020</span> --><p>I live in San Francisco. Some people I know are worried about living in US cities at election time because of the potential for political unrest. This seems surprising to me, since I figure the chance of rioting harming a specific person in a large city is very low, especially if that person takes the precaution of not being intentionally at a riot. If I thought the chance of a riot so incredibly huge and destructive that one in a thousand people in my city is killed is as high as one in a thousand, that is still only giving me around a one in a million chance of death, i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromort#Travel">similar to</a> the risk from a flight to New York. Possibly I’m not being imaginative enough.</p>

        <!-- <span class="post-meta">Oct 16, 2020</span> --><p>In case others also wanted to see <a href="/_posts/2010-10-15-problems-and-gratitudes">more round seals</a>, I present several that I came across in my investigation of illustrations for that last post, and a more extended the seal perusal that followed.</p>

<p>On considering the existence of seals more, I came to wonder how this body design—short plump fur snake with weirdly placed flipper limbs, apparently optimized for being extremely cute while lying in one place—could possibly evolve in a world where animal dexterity can get pretty high (e.g. also leopards exist) and there is just no obvious upside for seals being so cute. After minor YouTube investigation, I think a) seals are not somehow surprisingly agile on land; b) seals live in water, where this seems to be an excellent body design; c) penguins and seals are fairly similarly shaped water creatures, but in their awkward land phase, rest on different edges.</p>

        <!-- <span class="post-meta">Oct 15, 2020</span> --><p>Being grateful is often suggested as a good and scientific way to raise some kind of wellbeing measure. Probably somehow resulting from that, and from my much greater enjoyment of being grateful than of investigating this claim at all, sometimes I embark on a concerted effort to be grateful for specific things.</p>

<p>However I am sometimes confused about directing gratitude, in a similar way to how I am confused about considering things ‘problems’. Is there a problem—never spoken of but so much bigger than anything that ever is—of everyone not being able to access vast quantities of wisdom and pleasure by pressing their belly buttons?</p>

<p>Maybe I should be grateful that the horsehead nebula isn’t a real horsehead?</p>

<p>Sometimes I fantasize about a future where stealing someone’s attention to suggest for the fourteenth time that they watch your awful-looking play is rightly looked upon as akin to picking their pocket.</p>

<p>Stepping back, advertising is widely found to be a distasteful activity. But I think it is helpful to distinguish the different unpleasant flavors potentially involved (and often not involved—there is good advertising):</p>

But a nice thing about going to bed is that you can be confident that you are doing roughly the best thing. At noon, the smallness of the chance that your chosen task is really among the best ways to spend your precious moments in this world might be discouraging or oppressive. Perhaps you would only have to be a tiny bit smarter or think a bit longer to be able to recognize that this is the wrong way and that you could be doing much better. But at 4am, sleeping is probably pretty close to the most valuable thing.</p>

        <!-- <span class="post-meta">Oct 11, 2020</span> --><p>Today I watched some YouTube videos about the World Wars, and in particular how the first one came about. It did seem like a sequence of plausible sounding steps that led to a giant war. But there is an abstract level at which I still feel confused. Which is one where initially there are basically a very large number of humans who each very much don’t want to die presumably, most of whom have very little reason to kill almost any of the others. Then somehow this all turns into everyone putting huge amounts of effort in and risking their lives to kill each other. It is as if you told me that you had a barn full of soaking wet hay, and it turned into a big bonfire.</p>

<p>I suppose the natural explanation is that there are rulers, or in more game theoretic terms to match the incentive-level of my confusion:</p>
