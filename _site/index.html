      </h3><p>Brains are like computers in that the hardware can do all kinds of stuff in principle, but each one tends to run through some particular patterns of activity repeatedly. For computers you can change this by changing programs. What are big ways brain ‘software’ changes?</p>

      </h3><p>Have the Accelerationists won?</p>

<p>Last November Kevin Roose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/technology/openai-board-capitalists.html">announced</a> that those in favor of going fast on AI had now won against those favoring caution, with the reinstatement of Sam Altman at OpenAI. Let’s ignore whether Kevin’s was a good description of the world, and deal with a more basic question: if it were so—i.e. if Team Acceleration would control the acceleration from here on out—what kind of win was it they won?</p>

      </h3><p>A general thing I hadn’t noticed about debts until lately:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whenever Bob owes Alice, then Alice has reason to look after Bob, to the extent that increases the chance he satisfies the debt.</li>
  <li>Yet at the same time, Bob has an incentive for Alice to disappear, insofar as it would relieve him.</li>
</ul>

<p>These might be tiny incentives, and not overwhelm for instance Bob’s many reasons for not wanting Alice to disappear. </p>

      </h3><p>It’s interesting to me how chill people sometimes are about the non-extinction future AI scenarios. Like, there seem to be opinions around along the lines of “pshaw, it might ruin your little sources of ‘meaning’, Luddite, but we have always had change and as long as the machines are pretty near the mark on rewiring your brain it will make everything amazing”. Yet I would bet that even that person, if faced instead with a policy that was going to forcibly relocate them to New York City, would be quite indignant, and want a lot of guarantees about the preservation of various very specific things they care about in life, and not be just like “oh sure, NYC has higher GDP/capita than my current city, sounds good”.</p>

          Is suffering like shit?</a><span class="post-meta"> May 30, 2024</span>
      </h3><p>People seem to find suffering deep. Serious writings explore the experiences of all manner of misfortunes, and the nuances of trauma and torment involved. It’s hard to write an essay about a really good holiday that seems as profound as an essay about a really unjust abuse. A dark past can be plumbed for all manner of meaning, whereas a slew of happy years is boring and empty, unless perhaps they are <em>too</em> happy and suggest something dark below the surface. (More thoughts in the vicinity of this <a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.substack.com/p/home-up-and-down-colder-and-warmer-20-02-20">here</a>.)</p>

<p>I wonder if one day suffering will be so avoidable that the myriad hurts of present-day existence will seem to future people like the problem of excrement getting on everything. Presumably a real issue in 1100 AD, but now irrelevant, unrelatable, decidedly not fascinating or in need of deep analysis.</p>

<p>~ Feb 2021</p>

<p>The other day I decided to try imbibing work-relevant blog posts via AI-generated recital, while scaling the Twin Peaks—large hills near my house in San Francisco, of the sort that one lives near and doesn’t get around to going to. It was pretty strange, all around.</p>

          What is my Facebook feed about?</a><span class="post-meta"> May 15, 2024</span>
      </h3><p>Sometimes I look at social media a bunch, but it would be hard for me to tell you what the actual content is, I suppose because whenever I’m looking at it, I’m focused on each object thing level in turn, not the big picture. So sometimes I’m curious what it is I read about there. Here is the answer for Facebook, in 2019—according to a list I found that appears to be a survey of such—and again now. Plausibly not at a useful level of abstraction, but I have a bit of a migraine and no more energy for this project.</p>
