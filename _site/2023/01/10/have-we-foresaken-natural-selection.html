<meta name="description" content="Natural selection is often ascribed ‘goals’ for humanity, and humanity is often accused of falling down on them. The particular charge, if I understand, is of sub-maximal procreation. If we cared at all about the genetic proliferation that our ‘creator’ natural selection wanted for us, then this time of riches would be a time of twenty-five child families, not of only-children and pampered dogs. But—the story goes—our failure is understandable, because instead of a deep draw toward genetic survival, natural selection has merely fitted us out with myriad suggestive urges: passing penchants for xxx[passing desires to put appendages in orifices, and] This is generally floated as an illustrative warning about artificial intelligence. The moral is that if you make a system by first making myriad systems and then systematically destroying all the ones that don’t do the thing you want, then the machine you are left with might merely do what you want while current circumstances apply, rather than being endowed with a consistent desire for what you actually had in mind. Observing acquaintences dispute this point recently, it occurred to me that humans are actually weirdly aligned with natural selection, more than I can account for. Natural selection, in its broadest, truest sense, doesn’t care a jot about genes. Genes are a nice substrate on which natural selection tends to make pretty patterns by driving a sensical evolutionxxx: driving living beings toward interesting intricacies by powering evolution. But natural selection’s real love is existence. Natural selection just favors things that tend to exist. Things that start existing: great. Things having started existing, then survive: amazing. Things that reproduce are an interesting subclass: they don’t start existing that much in most circumstances, but once you have some, then other ones start to exist easily. As long as there’s a route to the first ones coming to be, natural selection is all over this. So natural selection likes genes that promote procreation and survival, but also likes ideas that are thought of and talked of, tools that are conceivable and copyable, elements that appear and don’t dissolve, shapes that result from myriad physical situations. Maybe this isn’t the dictionary definition of natural selection (narrator: it isn’txxx) but it is the real force in the world, of which natural selection of reproducing and surviving genetic clusters is one facet. Generalized natural selection says that the things that you see in the world are those things that survive best in the world. not sure what i was thinking when writing this earlier, but maybe: humans do seem to just care about their survival per se. there’s a good chance that something like their essence will make it to the far reaches of space, even though basically every action involved in that bears no superficial resemblance to the actions involved in not succumbing to the hunger of bears or xxx I’m not saying it’s the strongest urge. But I think the reasoning above is decent: it’s not obvious that we should expect humans to care about survival per se. And yet they seem to care about it a fair bit. weirdly, a bunch of the efforts to get to the far corners of space will have come from more historically explicable urges, e.g. to get dicks in desirable places. Yet the invisible hand coordinating our species directs these local urges into a non-negligible society-wide effort for survival. having children at this point isn’t obviously that good for the survival of a person’s genes, relative to them having more financial wealth and flexibility. I don’t think many people are failing to have children because they appreciate that they might soon be able to produce genetically enhanced clones or upload their brains, but it’s interesting to me that at the point we might complain that they are under-procreating for proper manifestors of evolution’s values for them, it doesn’t seem actually true. What does this imply? This seems like a pretty obvious point, so I’m not put off it by it not applying that well to the example. But I think it doesn’t. Seems like there is an open question of: if you select for something like a ‘simple’ goal, how much should you expect to find creatures who have that goal, versus have a lot of hacky things, versus People often hand-wavily think of evolution as having ‘goals’ for human behavior: something like, ‘promoting the survival of genes’. People around me also often note that humans have lost their way relative to evolution’s ‘goals’, and that this might be relevant to how AI systems will behave in the long term, if we carefully select them to apparently fulfill our goals.
