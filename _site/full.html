            What is it like to be a tidy person?
          </a>
        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Nov 18, 2020</span>
        <p>A thing I have been curious about since I was about fourteen is why my living quarters are so much messier than other people’s. At that point it was mostly not my own fault, and now that it is, they are less messy. But still, there’s a clear gap between my room and many other people’s rooms that I see. Like for me, if you can see the places where the floor and the walls meet, or if there is a clear path between the door and at least one reasonable place to be in a room, these are victories (bonus points if you don’t have to do any unusual jumping or balancing to follow the path). And other people have entire twelve-foot cubes full of immaculately placed objects.</p>

<p>This might seem like a silly thing to wonder about. For one thing, isn’t it because I don’t choose to clean up my room, whereas they do? Or if not entirely that, isn’t it just that people vary, and I have the trait ‘messy’?</p>

<p>This isn’t very satisfying, because what does this difference looks like at a lower level? What is it like to be a tidy person? It’s not just about liking neatness I think. I love neatness. I fantasize every day about cleaning up my room, but then run out of time. It’s quite messy, so would be a lot of hassle to clean up, and I have a lot of things going on. Sometimes if I’m particularly on top of everything, I’ll substantially clean it up, but then as soon as I’m more overwhelmed with other things, I’ll let it slide again, and it will rapidly slide quite far. Kind of like other unsustainable virtuous lifestyle choices, like getting up extra early to read poetry before breakfast.</p>

<p>Maybe tidy people just <em>really</em> love tidiness, even more than I do? Or maybe they enjoy tidying, like I enjoy reading a little bit before bed, and somehow make time for it? Or do they just prioritize it even higher, like I prioritize work? Or do they have twice as much time or energy as me every day? Does messiness seem like an unconscionable sin, so that they wouldn’t dream of leaving an empty plate on their chest of drawers in the first place, even if they were in the middle of something? Would they never get home and toss a bag of stuff from an event in the corner rather than immediately unpacking it? Do they have fewer objects? (Yes, but I don’t think that explains it—for instance, I also manage to be a constant mild force for messiness in my boyfriend’s room. I suppose it could be about objects:storage ratio, but it doesn’t seem like it.) Does it somehow require less effort for tidy people to make things tidy?</p>

<p>I have thoughts, but first I’m curious to hear if any tidy people have insight.</p>

            Schelling points amidst communication
          </a>
        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Nov 17, 2020</span>
        <p>If two people are trying to meet in New York City, and they forgot to pick a spot, and both of their phones are dead, so they both just go and stand under the clock in Grand Central Station, hoping that the other will expect them to do that, guessing that if they were going to pick a spot to do this, it would be that one, then what you have is a Schelling point.</p>

<p>This is a pretty contrived circumstance, and I usually hear Schelling points talked of as if they are neat but only relevant in those rare cases when communication is impossible. For instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)">Wikipedia says</a> ‘In game theory, a focal point (or Schelling point) is a solution that people tend to choose by default in the absence of communication.’</p>

<p>As I was falling asleep last night, somewhere after imagining a kind of house made from genetically engineered trees that just grew into pleasing rounded house shapes roofed with massive leaves, it occurred to me that actually Schelling points are perfectly applicable and even very interesting in cases with communication. It’s just that when there is some combination of a relatively small amount of communication and clear norms about how to respond to communication, then communication often provides a particularly salient Schelling point, so there is not much of a question of what to do, and Schelling points don’t seem relevant.</p>

<p>When many things are being said, or there are other salient Schelling points, or it isn’t clear that everyone’s motives are trustworthy, or probably in other cases, there is no longer a determinate Schelling point necessarily.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ten thousand oppressed people have to decide when to launch a revolution against a tyrant. If a small number try to revolt alone, they are probably captured by the oppressors and useless to the revolution. So all ten thousand would like to coordinate to fight at once. They can communicate perfectly freely with one another. However there are constantly suggestions that it happen tonight from the youngest and least strategic members of the group, so if such a suggestion is made, everyone has to guess whether this is the one that everyone is going to get behind. Even if Alice is wise and makes such a suggestion, and Bob knows her to be wise, if Bob doesn’t think everyone will be sure enough that everyone will be sure enough, then he won’t want to go out tonight.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Charles and Dick are in a fight, and both would strongly like to not be in a fight, however would not like to stop fighting before their opponent, because then they might get punched extra. They also don’t really want to fight beyond when their opponent is fighting, because if they punch him extra, he will hold a grudge. So ideally they would stop at the same time. But there is another Nash equilibrium at both continuing to fight (i.e. if both were going to fight more, neither would want to stop earlier). So they have to try to coordinate on one of the Nash equilibria. Charles says that he is going to stop now, but that doesn’t inform Dick much, because of course Charles wants Dick to think Charles is stopping, since then he too will stop. But Charles always wants Dick to stop sooner, regardless of his own plans. So the communication is hopeless in normal terms, and at least not automatically a Schelling point.</p>

    <p>Here is the table of payoffs for one punch:</p>

    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td> </td>
          <td>stop</td>
          <td>punch</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>stop</td>
          <td>5, 5</td>
          <td>-5, 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>punch</td>
          <td>3, -5</td>
          <td>4, 4</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>Ellen and Frederick are meeting in New York City, and their phones are working fine, and Ellen texts ‘I’ll meet you outside the station in ten?’ and Fred texts ‘yeah’. But Ellen is somewhat tempted to go in and wait under the clock because she and Fred met there once before under highly romantic circumstances, and she is interested in going back there, as it were, but from their current platonic situation, it would be weird to just ask him to meet under the clock again, or to immediately proposition him. She figures that if he feels the same way, and their coordination game is on point, he will actually wait for her under the clock, then come outside if she doesn’t show up. And if he’s not there, well, she tried, and will be a minute late outside. Frederick also figures he might be able to risk-free learn if she feels the same way, and waits inside.</li>
</ul>

<p>You might argue that these are not all ‘communication’ in some strict sense of genuine information in fact being cheap to convey. Fair enough probably, but in that strict sense, limits to communication are more common.</p>

<p>You might argue that these are still all very contrived examples. Which is fair, but I suspect it stems at least partly from how hard it is to come up with examples, especially if they are examples of a game theoretic situation you recently thought of being manifest.</p>

<p>I assume this is not an original point, but don’t know who it is unoriginal because of. If you liked this post, you might like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strategy-Conflict-New-Preface-Author/dp/0674840313">The Strategy of Conflict</a>, which for all I know literally has this point in it, but at least has a lot more good discussion of Schelling points, including introducing the concept.</p>

        <!--<p>If two people are trying to meet in New York City, and they forgot to pick a spot, and both of their phones are dead, so they both just go and stand under the clock in Grand Central Station, hoping that the other will expect them to do that, guessing that if they were going to pick a spot to do this, it would be that one, then what you have is a Schelling point.</p>

        <p>When basically everyone in the world faces the same problem, it is interesting if everyone does their own working out to solve it. Even if there isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer, you might think it would be massively more efficient to do a good job of answering once with some free variables.</p>

<p>For instance, my impression is that even before covid, basically everyone was sometimes possibly a bit sick and had to decide whether to go to an event, given that they might be contagious. The usual thing to do, I think, was to consider the question for a bit yourself (or not, depending on conscientiousness), and to maybe mention it to the host and try to guess how annoyed the other guests would be, and then to make a call. But this isn’t a highly personal question—if someone who knew more about infectious disease contagion than most people (which wouldn’t be hard) made a form to tell you what to do based on your symptoms and the number of people at the event, you would probably already be making a better choice, faster, than most people.</p>

<p>Why doesn’t this happen?</p>

<p>Some answers I can think of:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It would be great, but it isn’t anyone’s job, and it’s hard to profit from it because hardly anyone will give you a cent for making their judgment for them.</li>
  <li>It would be more effort to open the calculator than the thought most people put into this. (Relatedly, all apparent examples of this are just ‘how worried should I be about X’ where X is something that actually nobody is worried about unless they have an anxiety disorder. There is a form for solving this and it is called a psychiatry intake form.)</li>
  <li>If someone made such a thing, there is no way that more than a minuscule fraction of the world would come to know about it.</li>
  <li>Such things exist all over the place, and everyone else is using them and have just never mentioned them to me</li>
  <li>Such things really do involve a lot of personal information somehow</li>
  <li>Few people would trust such a tool enough to do what it said</li>
  <li>This sort of thing just isn’t a thing, and people mostly do things that are things. The market isn’t efficient. Everyone’s personal lives are currently like pre-Moneyball baseball.</li>
  <li>Nobody knows the answers to these questions. It’s possible to have a better answer than most people’s made up ones (e.g. by averaging most people’s made up answers, or having an expert make something up), but nobody wants to either stand behind that, or pay for it.</li>
  <li>This case is a mysterious anomaly, but there aren’t many such cases. For instance, can you think of more good ones right now? No.</li>
</ol>

<p>Figuring out the covid risk of different activities is another example of massive potential replication of effort, though in that case <a href="https://www.microcovid.org/">microcovid.org</a> (and perhaps others) stepped up.</p>

<p>I have a similar feeling at a smaller scale about speculating about the future of AI, which is perhaps why I run <a href="http://aiimpacts.org/">aiimpacts.org</a> and other people don’t. (While that enlightens me on some specific things that might go wrong with trying to do this, it’s hard for a particular project to shed light on the problems with a category it is in, since it is in many categories and presumably might have problems from all of them.)</p>

<p>P.S. Yes, I believe the word is ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_prefix">octobillion</a> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple#Names_for_tuples_of_specific_lengths">upling</a>’</p>

            Schedules versus momentum
          </a>
        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Nov 15, 2020</span>
        <p>A mundane issue that arises endlessly in my life, but which I haven’t heard that much advice on: what to do when your schedule says you should do one thing, but you have momentum on a different thing? Or more broadly, what to do when scheduling and energy for a task conflict?</p>

<p>People often have schedules (or other intentions around times or orders of activities), and often have momentum or excitement about activities, so I assume these also conflict for others. I include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>when a period intended for something ends, and you haven’t finished it</li>
  <li>when a period for starting something occurs, and you haven’t finished the last thing</li>
  <li>when a period for something occurs and you really don’t feel like it relative to something else that is perfectly productive, but not the intended activity.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If it’s ‘bed time’, but you are making a lot of progress on writing, should you go to bed?</li>
  <li>If you mean to stop work and go outside at 5pm, and now it is 5pm and you are in the middle of something that will be annoying to get back to, do you stop and go outside?</li>
  <li>If you meant to set aside 3h on Sunday for working on some self-improvement things, and it is now an hour into that period because you woke up late, and also you haven’t finished figuring out what you need to do today at all, should you move immediately to the planned time block or finish planning your day and getting up?</li>
  <li>If you meant to write in your planner every morning before work, and it is work time and you haven’t done it, should you start work fifteen minutes late?</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course the answer is ‘it depends’: there are some circumstances where you should stick with what you are doing or excited about, and others you should stick to the plan. But I wonder how far to lean one way or the other, or what it should depend on.</p>

<p>I think in practice it is a thing I make many judgments about without a lot of thought, and without remembering or learning from the huge number of other such judgments I’ve made. Has anyone else done better?</p>

        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Nov 13, 2020</span>
        <p>One can feel stupid for not having tried the obvious thing. For instance, if you have terrible anxiety, and you tell your friend, and your friend is like, ‘um, have you considered anxiety drugs?’, and somehow it hasn’t occurred to you, you can feel stupid.</p>

<p>I think this is often wrong, because there are so many obvious things. The implicit assumption in the line of reasoning suggesting that you should be embarrassed is that you should have thought of the obvious thing first. But there is at least one obvious thing for every way of looking at a situation. So you can’t think of all of them first because there are so many of them. For instance, having framed your recent life as ‘having an anxiety disorder’, obvious things to do might include therapy, psychiatry, trusting your own assessment of what is alarming less, doing exposure therapy on your own, reading self-help books, exercise, trying to be less anxious.. And if a few days ago you were thinking of your situation as more ‘not being on top of things’, then the obvious things would be different. If earlier today you were thinking of the situation as ‘I really don’t want to leave the house today, for this thing’, then other options will be obvious. And these are all just ways of framing a particular thread in your life. At the same time, there will be obvious things to do about the fact that you don’t have an office chair, and to do about how you like musicals, and to do about being unfit, and so on.</p>

<p>You can’t think of every obvious thing immediately, because there are so many of them. You can spend all day doing things that would obviously improve your life, and then have someone tell you another obvious thing.</p>

<p>An upshot of this is that in my ideal world, people would not refrain from suggesting solutions because they seem too obvious, because nobody would be offended that their friend really thinks it might not have occurred to them to try anxiety drugs if they have a bad anxiety disorder.</p>

<p>It’s also possible that I’m just uniquely bad at considering all obvious things at all times, in which case that last point just applies to me.</p>

            Misalignment and misuse: whose values are manifest?
          </a>
        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Nov 13, 2020</span>
        <p>AI related disasters are often categorized as involving misaligned AI, or misuse, or accident. Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>misuse means the bad outcomes were wanted by the people involved,</li>
  <li>misalignment means the bad outcomes were wanted by AI (and not by its human creators), and</li>
  <li>accident means that the bad outcomes were not wanted by those in power but happened anyway due to error.</li>
</ul>

<p>In thinking about specific scenarios, these concepts seem less helpful.</p>

<p>I think a likely scenario leading to bad outcomes is that AI can be made which gives a set of people things they want, at the expense of future or distant resources that the relevant people do not care about or do not own.</p>

<p>For example, consider autonomous business strategizing AI systems that are profitable additions to many companies, but in the long run accrue resources and influence and really just want certain businesses to nominally succeed, resulting in a worthless future. Suppose Bob is considering whether to get a business strategizing AI for his business. It will make the difference between his business thriving and struggling, which will change his life. He suspects that within several hundred years, if this sort of thing continues, the AI systems will control everything. Bob probably doesn’t hesitate, in the way that businesses don’t hesitate to use gas vehicles even if the people involved genuinely think that climate change will be a massive catastrophe in hundreds of years.</p>

<p>When the business strategizing AI systems finally plough all of the resources in the universe into a host of thriving 21st Century businesses, was this misuse or misalignment or accident? The strange new values that were satisfied were those of the AI systems, but the entire outcome only happened because people like Bob chose it knowingly (let’s say). Bob liked it more than the long glorious human future where his business was less good. That sounds like misuse. Yet also in a system of many people, letting this decision fall to Bob may well have been an accident on the part of others, such as the technology’s makers or legislators.</p>

<p>Outcomes are the result of the interplay of choices, driven by different values. Thus it isn’t necessarily sensical to think of them as flowing from one entity’s values or another’s. Here, AI technology created a better option for both Bob and some newly-minted misaligned AI values that it also created—‘Bob has a great business, AI gets the future’—and that option was worse for the rest of the world. They chose it together, and the choice needed both Bob to be a misuser and the AI to be misaligned. But this isn’t a weird corner case, this is a natural way for the future to be destroyed in an economy.</p>

        <p>I get migraines about once a week. They aren’t as bad as migraines are classically understood to be—in fact they always start out pretty mild—but they sometimes become terrible by the evening.</p>

<p>While there are always various things I could do to improve such situations, I have often failed to do them promptly. Which seems pretty weird, but I suppose I am not at my most energetic and mentally functional. Also, none of the interventions I know of actually resolve migraines instantaneously, so my sense that I should for instance take painkillers is more of an intellectual one than a felt urge. And I think suffering drains my interest in upholding vague intellectual senses that I should do things. Then even if I did remember, it’s a further effort to even recall what else might be good, let alone go and find the relevant objects.</p>

<p>I have improved this a fair bit with a retrospectively obvious innovation: the migraine basket. It’s a diaper caddy which typically contains all things that might help with migraines, or some physical symbol of them if they don’t fit (e.g. a pick stands for playing guitar).</p>

<p><img src="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/assets/migraine-basket.jpg" alt="migraine-basket" /></p>

<p>Now if I remember at all to do anything, I am reminded of, and handed, everything. And the motion to make this happen is like ‘grab or ask for visually obvious basket’ not ‘try to remember if you put your painkillers in your bag and also where you put your bag’. I’ve had it for several months, and it seems good.</p>

        <p>Over toothbrushing tonight, my boyfriend and I analyzed the song ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9MvdMqKvpU">Colors of the Wind</a>’, from Pocahontas, which we had just listened to in curiosity over Roger Ebert’s <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-hunchback-of-notre-dame-1996">claim</a> that The Hunchback of Notre Dame has a better message than Pocahontas.</p>

<p>A pair of lines that caught my attention were:</p>

<p><em>‘Come roll in all the riches all around you</em>
<em>And for once, never wonder what they’re worth’</em></p>

<p>This suggests that wondering what everything is worth negates what is valuable about it, which is to say, makes it worth less to you. Is it true that looking out for value like this is self-undermining? It sounds plausible to me, but why?</p>

<p>A first idea we had is that some goals are self-reinforcing. For instance, if you consume things a lot, then you want to consume even more next time, and when that’s hard then you get even more desperate to consume, and so just increasingly focused on consuming, and therefore maybe inattentive to other potentially good things. Similarly for some other goals, such as making money.</p>

<p>Another thought is that ‘what they’re worth’ means ‘what you can sell them for’, and what you can sell them for is often a subset of the values on the table. So if you look out for what things are worth and then sell them for that, you will lose a lot of other value.</p>

<p>My favorite explanation is that the world is very complicated, so in order to interact with it at all, you have to make much simpler summary versions for use in your head. For instance, you might think of there being a drawer in the kitchen with flour and sugar in it, rather than thinking of there being a whole conglomeration of specks of wheat and splinters of wood and screws and glues and plastics, or of a massive cloud of atoms.</p>

<p>There are lots of different ways of simplifying the same scene, and for different purposes, you probably want different ones. If you are drawing a picture of the kitchen, you might simplify the same part of it to a grainy brown rectangle cupboard front. If you are showing your parents around your apartment, it might just be one of several ‘safe to open’ cupboards, that isn’t holding anything rapidly hidden and alarming.</p>

<p>The world is like a gameboard on which you can play a multitude of different games, but for each one you only pay attention to the few aspects of the board that are relevant to that game. Sometimes you use the chess squares and ignore the snakes and ladders between them, sometimes you just put Go stones on the corners.</p>

<p>Supposing that your brain automatically adjusts the salience of parts of the gameboard for the game you are playing, this means that what game you are playing affects what you see. For instance, if at a party you are playing the game, ‘come up with good insights and say them’, you are less likely to see your friend Fred glance momentarily at your friend Serena than you are if you are playing the game, ‘observe everything about Fred’, or the game, ‘check how people are doing at the party’. In none of these cases will you see the beautiful walnut chair, but you might if you were playing ‘locate beautiful things’ or ‘figure out how rich the hosts are now’.</p>

<p>So the basic issue is that if you play games like, ‘how much can I sell this for?’, or even ‘what can this do for me?’, you end up living in a simplified world that emphasizes financial and pragmatic possibilities but lacks a lot of richness that would bring value not via either being sold or doing something tangible. Which is arguably a lot of the richness.</p>

<p>Then a sad thing is that from this vantage, you don’t appear to be missing anything. So indeed it seems the best you can do is collect up that which can be sold or tangibly leveraged, since that is all the world has to offer. Similarly, if you are so hungry for potato chips that all you can see is whether a thing is potato chips, you might conclude that this is a reasonable way to be, what with everything either being potato chips or not, and potato chips being better than not.</p>

        <p>Should social media label statements as false, misleading or contested?</p>

<p>Let’s approach it from the perspective of what would make the world best, rather than e.g. what rights do the social media companies have, as owners of the social media companies.</p>

<p>The basic upside seems to be that pragmatically, people share all kinds of false things on social media, and that leads to badness, and this slows that down.</p>

<p>The basic problem with it is that maybe we can’t distinguish worlds where social media companies label false things as false, and those where they label things they don’t like as false, or things that aren’t endorsed by other ‘official’ entities. So maybe we don’t want such companies to have the job of deciding what is considered true or false, because a) we don’t trust them enough to give them this sacred and highly pressured job forever, or b) we don’t expect everyone to trust them forever, and it would be nice to have better recourse when disagreement appears than ‘but I believe them’.</p>

<p>If there were a way to systematically inhibit or label false content based on its falseness directly, rather than via a person’s judgment, that would be an interesting solution that perhaps everyone reasonable would agree to add. If prediction markets were way more ubiquitous, each contentious propositional Tweet could say under it the market odds for the claim.</p>

<p>Or what if Twitter itself were a prediction market, trading in Twitter visibility? For just-posted Tweets, instead of liking them, you can bet your own cred on them. Then a while later, they are shown again and people can vote on whether they turned out right and you win or lose cred. Then your total cred determines how much visibility your own Tweets get.</p>

<p>It seems like this would solve:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the problem for prediction markets where it is illegal to bet money and hard to be excited about fake money</li>
  <li>the problem for prediction markets where it’s annoying to go somewhere to predict things when you are doing something else, like looking at Twitter</li>
  <li>the problem for Twitter where it is full of fake claims</li>
  <li>the problem for Twitter users where they have to listen to fake claims all the time, and worry about whether all kinds of things are true or not</li>
</ul>

<p>It would be pretty imperfect, since it throws the gavel to future Twitter users, but perhaps they are an improvement on the status quo, or on the status quo without the social media platforms themselves making judgments.</p>

        <span class="post-meta">Nov 8, 2020</span>
        <p>I was woken yesterday by cheering and whooping in the streets.</p>

<p>(Which was overall great, though I think replacing the part of the day, [get enough sleep and then wake up and remember who you are and what you were doing and then do some familiar morning rituals while your brain warms up] with [abrupt emergence into city-wide celebration] was disorienting in a way that I failed to shake all day.)</p>

<p>After some music, Champagne, party hats, chatting with the housemates, and putting on our best red-white-and-blue outfits, my boyfriend and I set out for a walk in the city, tentatively toward b. patisserie, legendary and inconveniently distant producer of kouignoù amann.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Within a few blocks we found cars and pedestrians breaking into rounds of cheering and waving at each other, and a general sense that the whole street was a party to this. We still had our party hats, one with an American flag sticking out of the top, so there was no ambiguity for other street-goers about whether we were.</p>

<p>We took a detour for downtown Castro, to see if it was more exciting. Apparently that was in fact the Schelling point for being excited together. When we got to the intersection with Castro street, cars were still going through it slowly, but each one seemed like an event somehow. While we watched, the crowd overcame the road entirely.</p>

<p><a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMCa9vDPnFFj_bvlkjKYfxDVDFCY8tliZ29oN7VRFP5aMDyJqebh3RWVUSajUxIMw/photo/AF1QipNorZHqiyOGLq_5ruTe6OwXolcKcysu94ZJfrc_?key=cmRCcUxaWV82RXpMRDUwS2hYcDJxbzhJNFpCZGxR"><img src="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/assets/castroparty.png" alt="Castro party" /></a>
<em>(click for video)</em></p>

<p>I wasn’t keen to walk through this, due to my poor imagination for how aerosols work in large outdoor crowds, so we turned back up a side street and went around. Roads seemed fuller than they have been since March, I think with people just driving around for the revelry. I soon wished that I had brought a musical instrument, when my hands were tired from clapping. A couple passed us with little bells in each hand to tinkle. We received compliments on our (very minimal) cardboard hats.</p>

<p>Away from the Castro it was a bit more normal. We stopped to get coffee and a woman outside the cafe asked us if we were celebrating the election. “Uh, yes?” “Does that mean it’s been called?” “Yes!” She was glad. She had been aggressively avoiding the election coverage apparently, and I suppose the scene in the park outside the cafe could also be explained by it being a surpassingly pleasant Saturday on normal weather related grounds. The cafe was selling Champagne. We bought a bottle.</p>

<p>The next park we got to was even less celebratory—at a glance, more full of inert young people at very safe distances, engaged in solitary phones and music and such. But over the hill a group of women were playing loud music and called out to us. ‘It’s our fuck Trump playlist! Enjoy!’ We stood a while on the crest of the hill and looked out over the city. A band of dogs frolicked in the sun, the light making a halo in the white mane of a golden retriever.</p>

<p>“What are the chances they actually have kouign amann?” For some reason places generally say they will sell kouignoù amann, but then don’t actually have any, or only have one, or are closed at all of the times you ever want a kouign amann. Philz Coffee has been out of kouignoù amann for at least a month. I had a better feeling about this place though. The one time I went there years ago, it had more of a kouign amann production outlet vibe, and veritable mounds of kouignoù amann of different flavors. Still, approaching the bakery at last, we hardly dared hope. I put 55% on kouignoù amann, but admitted that that probably meant 40%, empirically. He was much less optimistic.</p>

<p>But we reached the bakery, and it had stand after stand of them. We asked if we could really buy like ten of them, or whether this would deprive others. We could. We noticed another case with as many kouignoù amann again. We got eleven, and some cookies and cake too. Then on the way home we stumbled upon another noted kouignoù amann bakery, and got one more.</p>

            Why Trump? A survey

        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Nov 6, 2020</span>
        <p>It felt strange going into this US election so hopeful for Biden to win while so at a loss regarding why comparably many Americans were badly hoping for the opposite. I heard people <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/224-key-trumps-appeal/">speculating</a> about the possible motives, and I considered plausible steelmen. But why should I be guessing about what half of people think? I <a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/11/05/election-survey.html">figured out</a> how to survey some Americans beyond my vicinity.</p>

<p>I surveyed about 63 people, asking them:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Who did you vote for in the US presidential election 2020?</li>
  <li>What was the reasoning behind your choice?</li>
  <li>What would be the worst thing about your least favorite candidate winning?</li>
  <li>Who do you think is going to win?</li>
  <li>What went through your head when Trump said that he had won the election already on Tuesday night?</li>
</ul>

<p>20 out of 63 preferred Trump (19 voted plus one would have chosen Trump if forced to vote). Here is the reasoning they gave for their choices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HE SUPPORTS FOR WELFARE</li>
  <li>spite</li>
  <li>I want a better America!</li>
  <li>I like the presidency over the lead of the Donald Trump.</li>
  <li>THE SOCIETY VERY CAREFUL PERSON OF THE ELECTION VOTE TRUMP AND VERY GOOD ELECTION</li>
  <li>SUPPORTING THE WELFARE</li>
  <li>the only of good electionship of a best moment</li>
  <li>He has been a good ;leader delivering on all his promises.</li>
  <li>I’m a republican and i just have to vote for trump because he represents the republican party even though he’s not smart.</li>
  <li>IT IS MY OPINION</li>
  <li>he was an trusted person and good one</li>
  <li>I believe in what Donald Trump stands for. I cannot vote Democrat because I am a Christian who is Pro-Life.</li>
  <li>He is the most qualified to lead the country, regardless of his character that many hate.</li>
  <li>I support his America First agenda</li>
  <li>I feel he is the better choice to lead us</li>
  <li>Supreme court, guns, political correctness.</li>
  <li>With the economy precociousending radical race theory, creating peace in the middle east, and working with Americans so that we are treated fairly locally and globally, I believe he deserves a second term to continue his work.</li>
  <li>Trump is saving america from the chi com globalists.</li>
  <li>Trump has done some good things for the economy. I also believe he has strengthened our national security.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is what would go badly if Trump loses, according to these respondents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HE OPPOSES</li>
  <li>fraud against the American electorate</li>
  <li>unsure</li>
  <li>Choosing the right ecommerce platform for the business digital presence is critical. Also to find the one that meets the needs.</li>
  <li>TRUMP WINNING</li>
  <li>HE OPPOSE</li>
  <li>He’s not likely to win in South Carolina it is the good election</li>
  <li>The country will be destroyed.</li>
  <li>The Democratic candidate would probably increase the tax on the rich which i think is not fair.</li>
  <li>I DONT KNOW</li>
  <li>they will not interact with people directly</li>
  <li>Turning this country into a socialist country.</li>
  <li>A rebellion may start in the country.</li>
  <li>Massive increase of illegal immigration</li>
  <li>The direction he will take our country</li>
  <li>Political correctness winning, them thinking that since they won, they can go to even more extremes.</li>
  <li>More wars, corruption in government, and media suppression on conservative thoughts.</li>
  <li>China becomes the world super power.</li>
  <li>I believe Joe Biden’s policies would move America away from nationalism and toward socialism.</li>
</ul>

<p>What to make of that?</p>

<p>I noted yesterday that <a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/11/05/election-survey.html">everyone thinks their candidate will win</a></p>

<p>Another notable thing is that a large number of responses are hard to make sense of. A friend suggested many are bots, but none of the apparent Biden-leaning responses are like this, and would bots always claim to vote Trump? (Also, aren’t bots good at writing now?)</p>

<p>Here are a few arbitrarily chosen answers to the reasoning question from Biden supporters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I am a democrat, and I love their policies</li>
  <li>I felt we need a traditional U.S president. I also felt he might bring some stability to the U.S.</li>
  <li>Trump is the worse leader in US history. We need a strong leader now that unites us and helps us move forward rather than creating division.</li>
  <li>Biden is a Democrat.</li>
  <li>I am a democrat. But more importantly, I am so sick of Trump’s lies, manipulation, and general hateful divisive attitude. We need to get the country together and reassert ourselves as a respectable nation.</li>
  <li>Joe Biden’s policies actually aim to help Americans as well as protecting the environment while Trump is a pseudo dictator who’s broken countless laws and continues to do so, on top of being a racist, misogynistic, terrible person.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m3c13EOE2nlqQVU-1Ekilcz-wxxZVrUEe8Jm7qjsjLo/edit?usp=sharing">Here</a> is all of the data.</p>

<p>Here’s my summary of the issues that Biden and Trump supporters care about, by number of mentions [ETA: including all that at least two people cared about]:</p>

<p><img src="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/assets/issues.png" alt="voter issues" /></p>

<p>(There are really about half as many Trump supporters as Biden supporters, but they are under-represented in the graph because I was less able to make out particular issues in what they wrote, whereas Biden supporters often mentioned multiple issues.)</p>

        <p>Last night I was especially curious about why people vote as they do, and whether they were experiencing the election similarly to me. So I set up a survey in <a href="https://www.positly.com/">Positly</a> and paid a bunch of people to tell me about such things.</p>

<p>I haven’t read all of the responses yet, but a notable feature of them so far is the extent to which people expected their own favorite candidate to win the presidency.  If someone said both who they voted for (or would vote for if forced to vote) and who they thought would win, these were the same person 87% of the time.</p>

<p>Is this just ‘wishful thinking’ (whatever that is) or some more interesting phenomenon?</p>

        <p>Earlier in the evening, I reasoned that I should not ‘watch’ the election, since I will learn the result in the end and experiencing the uncertainty in the meantime doesn’t seem productive at all, let alone competitive with other things I could do.</p>

<p>This attitude somehow felt unfriendly though, or like being the kind of spoilsport who says ‘there is no reason to celebrate Christmas, or to celebrate anything for that matter’—both failing to add to the fun, and implicitly asking others to defend their own enthusiasm.</p>

<p>I think it’s related to how everyone is experiencing this thing together, and whether or not anyone has fun per se, there is something good in sharing it. And I do appreciate being part of a country-sized crowd looking the same way.</p>

<p>I wish the evening involved more familiarity with voters dissimilar to me though. The evolving plot would be more interesting if every time something surprising happened at a vast statistical level, a camera zoomed in to three random voters from that place who behaved surprisingly, for a short interview on what they were actually thinking. My guess is that it is often more inspiring than suspected, and it would be nice to know the nation better.</p>

        <!--<p>Earlier in the evening, I reasoned that I should not ‘watch’ the election, since I will learn the result in the end and experiencing the uncertainty in the meantime doesn’t seem productive at all, let alone competitive with other things I could do.</p>

            Why are bananas not my brothers?
          </a>
        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Nov 3, 2020</span>
        <p>It is said that we share <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-does-the-fact-that-w/">99.9%</a> of our genes with one another, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-does-the-fact-that-w/">95%</a> with chimpanzees, and <a href="https://www.breakthroughs.com/foundations-science/how-genetically-related-are-we-bananas">60%</a> with bananas. (It is also <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/genetic/people-bananas-share-dna.htm">said</a> that this isn’t quite right about bananas, but reading about that did not quell my confusion.)</p>

<p>It is further said that I share 50% of my genes with my brother, and that this is why I like him.</p>

<p>And yet, I seem to be more closely related to my brother than to a banana.</p>

<p>A natural way to resolve this incongruity is to suppose that my brother and I share 50% of the 0.01% of genes that might possibly vary between two humans, which we call ‘50% of my genes’ as a shorthand.</p>

<p>But this raises a problem. The usual explanation for familial affection evolving is that since my brother shares half of my genes, from a genetic perspective it is half-selfish for me to look after his welfare. So genes that make me care about my brother tend to spread.</p>

<p>But on this new model where ‘50%’ is shorthand for ‘50% of the way between virtually all and all’, taking care of my brother is about as good as taking care of myself (genetically). And a banana is worthy of my kin affection more than I thought my brother was. All living creatures are my family, and all humankind is myself.</p>

<p>This does not describe my feelings about bananas, and to learn of a basic biological drive for selflessness across vast swathes of the tree of life would be a bit of a surprise.</p>

<p>How does this actually work?</p>

        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Nov 1, 2020</span>
        <p>Today I spent about three hours chatting with eleven of my closer friends who I’ve mostly hardly seen this year, as a virtual birthday party. I thought the discussion was pretty interesting—so I record here some of the questions that came up (aloud or my mind):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Did various of us err by not doing technical subjects in undergrad? Or should we have tried to do ‘cool’ seeming subjects, technical or not?</li>
  <li>What is ‘coolness’? Is coolness always about power? Why is a big, fast train cool? Can you be cool if you are not relaxed? If you are small and scared? If you are mediocre in every way?</li>
  <li>Is etymology deep? What do people get out of knowing the origins of words?</li>
  <li>What is going on in history, at a high level?</li>
  <li>Can history be understood at a high level, or to have a real understanding of ‘what’s going on’, do you need to know about the detailed circumstances in each case?</li>
  <li>How did nations come about?</li>
  <li>Are various countries evil? What are we even asking here?</li>
  <li>How bad would it be if a ‘bad’ country came to control the world, forever?</li>
  <li>What reasons do we have to not worry about this, in the current situation?</li>
  <li>If history can be considered from various perspectives (a series of wars changing the borders of territories; a sequence of technological discoveries; a sequence of high level changes affecting the nature of technological discovery; a sequence of particular people and their biographies..) why is the version that is all about countries warring for territory always the one taught in ‘history’?</li>
  <li>Why do wars happen? What does IR say about this?</li>
  <li>How do the different theories of how wars happen relate to one another? On the model where it is all about entities exercising and maximizing power, why does it sometimes seem like ideas or institutions are playing a part?</li>
  <li>To the extent history is summarizable at a high level, involving wars between nations say, how too did ‘wars’ come to be a thing (if they are), rather than low level conflict being possible and sometimes realized at all times?</li>
  <li>Why don’t we hear more about the Uyghurs?</li>
  <li>Is improving the discourse an important cause?</li>
  <li>Has the public discourse worsened over time? How could we tell empirically?</li>
  <li>If the public discourse has worsened, why?</li>
  <li>Does public discourse seem worse because it has been more democratized, and listening to everyone means opening the floor to messages sent with less attention to conceptual clarity, or using different discourse norms, or constructed with less philosophical skill than when public expression was inaccessible to most people? Might it in that case be better overall, in a trade-off between representing values and knowledge from across the population, and average skill of expression and thought?</li>
  <li>What would I write if I felt free to express myself online?</li>
  <li>What is good about Hegel? Why do such philosophers feel to some like a campaign to gaslight people? What are our experiences of trying to read Hegel? Is it better understood as a guide to tripping?</li>
  <li>Supposing such philosophy is a way of conveying non-propositional stuff to put in your mind, couldn’t that still be talked about in an open and propositional way? For instance in an introduction that says ‘This book is a sequence of words that I believe will cause you to have a different experience of your relationship with the world if you read them.’</li>
  <li>Why doesn’t someone write a better account of any of these things? <a href="https://meteuphoric.com/2017/01/04/why-read-old-philosophy/">Why are we still reading the originals?</a></li>
</ol>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2020/11/01/automating-intelligence.html">
            Automated intelligence is not AI
          </a>
        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Nov 1, 2020</span>
        <p>Sometimes we think of ‘artificial intelligence’ as whatever technology ultimately automates human cognitive labor.</p>

<p>I question this equivalence, looking at past automation. In practice human cognitive labor is replaced by things that don’t seem at all cognitive, or like what we otherwise mean by AI.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Early in the existence of bread, it might have been toasted by someone holding it close to a fire and repeatedly observing it and recognizing its level of doneness and adjusting. Now we have machines that hold the bread exactly the right distance away from a predictable heat source for a perfect amount of time. You could say that the shape of the object embodies a lot of intelligence, or that intelligence went into creating this ideal but non-intelligent tool.</li>
  <li>Self-cleaning ovens replace humans cleaning ovens. Humans clean ovens with a lot of thought—looking at and identifying different materials and forming and following plans to remove some of them. Ovens clean themselves by getting very hot.</li>
  <li>Carving a rabbit out of chocolate takes knowledge of a rabbit’s details, along with knowledge of how to move your hands to translate such details into chocolate with a knife. A rabbit mold automates this work, and while this route may still involve intelligence in the melting and pouring of the chocolate, all rabbit knowledge is now implicit in the shape of the tool, though I think nobody would call a rabbit-shaped tin ‘artificial intelligence’.</li>
  <li>Human pouring of orange juice into glasses involves various mental skills. For instance, classifying orange juice and glasses and judging how they relate to one another in space, and moving them while keeping an eye on this. Automatic orange juice pouring involves for instance a button that can only be pressed with a glass when the glass is in a narrow range of locations, which opens an orange juice faucet running into a spot common to all the possible glass-locations.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some of this is that humans use intelligence where they can use some other resource, because it is cheap on the margin where the other resource is expensive. For instance, to get toast, you could just leave a lot of bread at different distances then eat the one that is good. That is bread-expensive and human-intelligence-cheap (once you come up with the plan at least). But humans had lots of intelligence and not much bread. And if later we automate a task like this, before we have computers that can act very similarly to brains, then the alternate procedure will tend to be one that replaces human thought with something that actually is cheap at the time, such as metal.</p>

<p>I think a lot of this is that to deal with a given problem you can either use flexible intelligence in the moment, or you can have an inflexible system that happens to be just what you need. Often you will start out using the flexible intelligence, because being flexible it is useful for lots of things, so you have some sitting around for everything, whereas you don’t have an inflexible system that happens to be just what you need. But if a problem seems to be happening a lot, it can become worth investing the up-front cost of getting the ideal tool, to free up your flexible intelligence again.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2020/10/31/birthday.html">
            Study of a 34th birthday
          </a>
        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Oct 31, 2020</span>
        <p>It was recently my birthday. I started the celebrations by sleeping in so late that I probably wouldn’t be that sleep deprived. My boyfriend continued the celebrations by making me breakfast in bed and setting aside his work, donning a hat, and singing to me when I woke. He actually always makes me breakfast and it is usually in bed, but that didn’t really detract from it.</p>

<p>I went to work in my own room, and had some success clarifying my thoughts about arguments for catastrophic risk from artificial intelligence in a Google doc. I took a quick walk in the sun. I dropped into a massive online town to have virtual coffee with my colleagues and other passers by.</p>

<p>I went back and discussed some troubling things with my boyfriend while standing on one leg, so that the discussion couldn’t possibly get out of hand and eat a lot of time.</p>

<p>We went out for a leisurely walk, but quickly realized that if we were going to eat cake on this day, we probably wanted to acquire it from a bakery a twelve minute walk away and get back to the house for his next appointment within less than 30 minutes. So it became a brisk walk up a giant hill and down the other side, to the slightly alternate universe of Noe Valley, where there are things like children and farmers markets and good but not fancy restaurants. The bakery had a queue, but we did not give up, and it turned out to be an extremely fast one so we got home with a creamy yellow passionfruit cake before too long.</p>

<p>Alone again, I opened a present I got myself, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RVMD414/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">giant piece of rope</a>. I keep having some unexplained hankering for hauling myself up a giant piece of rope. So I thought, why not? Now I am only impeded by my total lack of arm strength or general dexterity. (No this fantasy was not based on prior experience of climbing ropes, I think.)</p>

<p>In the midst of various kind offers to make food I like for dinner, I became flustered and couldn’t remember what is good to eat. I thought it might be okonomiyaki, but coludn’t find any for sale in my city. Eventually I happily went with what I always make: crispy fried silken tofu with craisins and nuts and greens. With the possible addition of farro, a recent interest. So we cranked up the music and made it together and drank green apple cider and ordered extra fries and jalapenos and such on the side.</p>

<p>My whole household joined for dinner, and we talked about why it isn’t possible to buy academic papers at prices that someone might plausibly pay, and whether it is generally better for the world if goods like Netflix movies are sold in large bundles (all of Netflix) rather than one at a time (pay per movie).</p>

<p>Then we got out a neat little box of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087P7QHKX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">polymer clay in many colors</a> that I recently acquired, and sculpted things while we played a game I remembered from years ago, though still don’t know the name of. You basically try to guess summary statistics of your group for different questions, then reveal the individual answers that let you see who was right. For instance, questions included ‘how many of us can play the tune of happy birthday on two different instruments without sheet music, but with five minutes to think about it?’ and ‘how many of us have kissed someone of our own sex?’</p>

<p>We then briefly played ‘what’s more unlikely?’ a game where you are presented with two very unlikely things, and try to convince a judge that one of them is less likely. For instance, is it more likely that by 2060 a potato has become president of the United States, or that a head of cabbage has? (Favored answer: potato)</p>

<p>We then had a round of ‘Katja is interviewed about things’ (“How do you feel about trees?”)</p>

<p>Then we played <a href="https://www.askhole.io/">askhole</a>, which was tamer and more wholesome than their website led me to expect. It was pretty good.</p>

<p>Eventually everyone went to bed, except for my boyfriend and I, who stayed to clean up a little more. But cleaning quickly turned to dancing, and dancing turned into dancing a lot. At least for me—he got tired and flopped around on a beanbag mostly. (This was arguably the best bit of the day, but I can’t elaborate  because I am falling asleep so aggressively while writing this that I just concluded this sentence with apparent nonsense.</p>

<p>In other news, if you don’t have the maximal number of cars in the massive garage of your weirdly proportioned house, and you aren’t allowed to rent out the space to another sub-letter, and you have eaten down some of your quarantine stores, and you mop up all the shards of broken fluorescent tube that fell there, and your housemate kindly lays out the mats, then you can sometimes have a rad private dance floor!</p>

        <span class="post-meta">Oct 30, 2020</span>
        <p>Without speaking to my own judgments of historical candidates, my impression is that people very often vote (in US primaries and elections at least) with an attitude of ‘ugh well it can’t be Alice, so I guess it has to be Bob, even though he is evil as far as I can tell’ rather than, ‘wow, Alice is one of the most shining examples of an excellent leader and all around good person I have ever witnessed, but I just have to vote for Bob because he is astonishingly even better, and when I see him speak it just makes me cry because I can’t donate money to his campaign fast enough’.</p>

<p>There are like <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-people-are-eligible-to-become-president">150 million</a> eligible US citizens to choose from for president, and in my experience many people generally inspire excitement and warmth in others, and are reasonable and knowledgeable and good. I admit I don’t really know how this whole system works, but if it’s some kind of popularity contest, with this many entrants, shouldn’t the results be reliably almost superhumanly likable? (Which is not to say superhumanly deserving of being liked, or superhumanly competent at running the country.)</p>

<p>A non-obvious but plausible category of answer is that such people really are superhumanly likable, but that the situation nonetheless leads to them seeming not so.</p>

<p>Another is that things were different not so long ago, and recent times are a weird aberration. (I welcome insight from anyone who was paying attention in the past.)</p>

            Empirical case study: how optimized are my Facebook ads?
          </a>
        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Oct 27, 2020</span>
        <p><em>(Other thoughts on <a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/">The Social Dilemma</a>: <a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/10/26/the-social-dilemma-review.html">one</a>, <a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/10/27/social-dilemma-2.html">two</a>)</em></p>

<p>For some more direct <a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/10/27/social-dilemma-2.html">evidence</a> about how aggressively Facebook optimizes its content, we can also look at its content.</p>

<p>Here are a bunch of ads it showed me yesterday (prompted by me seeing a particularly compelling ad (#2) and thinking of this, then just noting the other ones starting at the top of the page):</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Gates foundation plans to improve math education:</strong> interesting, but not so much that I even read it enough to know exactly what it was saying. I’m not sure what it wanted me to do, and am probably not going to do it. Probably slightly changes my perception of GF.</li>
  <li><strong>Something you put in your ears to make sounds less annoying:</strong> very well honed to my interests supposing it works, 50% chance I buy it in a few weeks, without checking if it works.</li>
  <li><strong>A kind of exercise object that I searched for yesterday because I found one in my garage:</strong> maybe interesting if I didn’t apparently have one, may have still reminded me to use the one I have, which could lead to buying more things from them.</li>
  <li><strong>6 different ads for political candidates:</strong> I’m a foreigner who can’t vote, so no dice.</li>
  <li><strong>a kind of non-coffee hot brown water with low-key drugs in it:</strong> a kind of thing I’m unusually interested in. Pretty weird because while I have recently renewed interest in such things, I think it has been entirely manifest in verbal discussion with housemates in the kitchen in terms like ‘brown water’, and in physically combining various roast grain substances that I found in my cupboard with hot water. I probably won’t buy it now, because I apparently have a lot of different brown waters in my cupboard, but decent chance I remember it and search for it in future.</li>
  <li><strong>New Oculus Quest, a VR machine that my house just got so I just tried for the first time:</strong> Again, unlikely to buy since I sort of have one, but plausible that prompting me to remember that it exists or think its cool is still helpful to them. I don’t remember searching for it, but did search for whether The Witness could be played in VR recently.</li>
  <li><strong>Another kind of obscure new drink containing mild drugs, this time alcohol-themed though probably not containing alcohol:</strong> Again, great try, though did not click.</li>
  <li><strong>Humorous T-shirts:</strong> not funny to me, and hard to imagine nearby scenario where I buy humorous t-shirt</li>
  <li><strong>Borat movie:</strong> advert suggests to me there is very little chance that I will like. Some chance I would so aggressively dislike that I am tempted to watch it to explore the nature of my dislike, but not that probable. Does increase my perception that movie is a big deal, so maybe that helps somehow.</li>
  <li><strong>The National Academy of Sciences is looking for nominations for a prize, in an ad that I would have missed if I wasn’t looking for ads, and my brain still wants to miss having noticed it:</strong> I don’t really know what I’m being asked, and am not curious enough to find out.</li>
  <li><strong>At home fitness program that I probably would have skimmed over, but I guess it looks maybe interesting, now that I am really attending to looking at ads:</strong> unlikely to click on or buy, but if I want such a thing in future, may remember that this one exists. Though not sure what it was called, so may have to search ‘home fitness videos sexy trainer and normal people exercising ad’, which doesn’t seem promising.</li>
</ol>

<p>So we have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>very well targeted and I don’t have: 2 (#2, #7)</li>
  <li>well to very well targeted but I have: 3 (#3, #5, #6)</li>
  <li>kind of interested to see, but not going to do anything: 3 (#1, #10, #11)</li>
  <li>not at all likely, but it’s subtle: 2 (#8, #9)</li>
  <li>basic demographic info would tell you there’s no chance: 6 (#4)</li>
</ul>

<p>(As an aside, 3/16 seem weirdly well targeted to the point that I assume they are based on fairly specific surveillance, or would if I could imagine how (#3, #5, #6).)</p>

<p>This seems to me very high variance: a mixture of surprisingly well targeted and surprisingly poorly targeted things.</p>

<p>It also seems more successful overall than I would think, but probably I should exclude the one that prompted me to think of doing this, which was #2.</p>

<p>On the <a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/10/26/the-social-dilemma-review.html">theory</a> that most of the optimization is going into making me look at Facebook for longer, rather than the ads themselves, the ads shouldn’t necessarily be very optimized. But on a theory where the manipulation is broader, or where the ad-makers are also powerfully optimizing, or any theory where I am being strongly compelled to do the things ads want me to do, then they should be.</p>

<p>Probably this has been overall some evidence for the ‘advertising is well optimized’ hypothesis, though I’m not sure how good I expected it to be.</p>

<p>I do have the broad sense that Facebook ads are much better than ads in any other place. For instance, I remember buying the things they offer sometimes, whereas I don’t remember that for ads elsewhere except signs in the street, though it must have happened.</p>

            Whence the symptoms of social media?
          </a>
        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Oct 27, 2020</span>
        <p>A thing I liked about <em>The Social Dilemma</em> was the evocative image of oneself being in an epic contest for one’s attention with a massive and sophisticated data-nourished machine, tended by teams of manipulation experts. The hopelessness of the usual strategies—like spur-of-the-moment deciding to ‘try to use social media less’—in the face of such power seems clear.</p>

<p>But <a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/10/26/the-social-dilemma-review.html">another</a> question I have is whether this basic story of our situation—that powerful forces are fluently manipulating our behavior—is true.</p>

<p>Some contrary observations from my own life:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The phenomenon of spending way too long doing apparently pointless things on my phone seems to be at least as often caused by things that are not massively honed to manipulate me.</strong> For instance, I recently play a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram">nonograms</a>, a kind of visual logic puzzle that was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram#History">invented by two people independently in the 80s</a> and which I play in one of many somewhat awkward-to-use phone apps, I assume made by small teams mostly focused on making the app work smoothly. My sense is that if I didn’t have nonograms style games or social media or news to scroll through, then I would still often idly pick up my phone and draw, or read books, or learn Spanish, or memorize geographic facts, or scroll through just anything on offer to scroll through (I also do these kinds of things already). So my guess is that it is my phone’s responsiveness and portability and tendency to do complicated things if you press buttons on it, that makes it a risk for time consumption. Facebook’s efforts to grab my attention probably don’t hurt, but I don’t feel like they are most of the explanation for phone-overuse in my own life.</li>
  <li><strong>Notifications seem clumsy and costly.</strong> They do grab my attention pretty straightforwardly, but this strategy appears to have about the sophistication of going up to someone and tapping them on the shoulder continually, when you have a sufficiently valuable relationship that they can’t just break it off you annoy them too much. In that case it isn’t some genius manipulation technique, it’s just burning through the goodwill the services have gathered by being valuable in other ways. If I get unnecessary notifications, I am often annoyed and try to stop them or destroy the thing causing them.</li>
  <li><strong>I do often scroll through feeds for longer than I might have planned to, but the same goes for non-manipulatively-honed feeds.</strong> For instance when I do a Google Image search for skin infections, or open some random report and forget why I’m looking at it. So I think scrolling down things might be a pretty natural behavior for things that haven’t finished yet, and are interesting at all (but maybe not so interesting that one is, you know, awake..)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>A thing that feels attractive about Facebook is that one wants to look at things that other people are looking at.</strong> (Thus for instance reading books and blog posts that just came out over older, better ones.) Social media have this, but presumably not much more than newspapers did before, since a greater fraction of the world was looking at the same newspaper before.</li>
</ul>

<p>In sum, I offer the alternate theory that various technology companies have combined:</p>
<ul>
  <li>pinging people</li>
  <li>about things they are at least somewhat interested in</li>
  <li>that everyone is looking at</li>
  <li>situated in an indefinite scroll</li>
  <li>on a responsive, detailed pocket button-box</li>
</ul>

<p>…and that most of the attention-suck and influence that we see is about those things, not about the hidden algorithmic optimizing forces that Facebook might have.</p>

        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Oct 26, 2020</span>
        <p>I watched <a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/">The Social Dilemma</a> last night. I took the problem that it warned of to be the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Social media and similar online services make their money by <a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/10/14/the-bads-of-ads.html">selling your attention to advertisers</a></li>
  <li>These companies put vast optimization effort into manipulating you, to extract more attention</li>
  <li>This means your behavior and attention is probably very shaped by these forces (which you can perhaps confirm by noting your own readiness to scroll through stuff on your phone)</li>
</ol>

<p>This seems broadly plausible and bad, but I wonder if it isn’t quite that bad.</p>

<p>I heard the film as suggesting that your behavior and thoughts in general are being twisted by these forces. But lets distinguish between a system where huge resources are going into keeping you scrolling say—at which point an advertiser will pay for their shot at persuading you—and a system where those resources are going into manipulating you directly to do the things that the advertiser would like. In the first case, maybe you look at your phone too much, but there isn’t a clear pressure on your opinions or behavior besides pro phone. In the second case, maybe you end up with whatever opinions and actions someone paid the most for (this all supposing the system works). Let’s call these distorted-looking and distorted-acting.</p>

<p>While watching I interpreted the film suggesting the sort of broad manipulation that would come with distorted-acting, but thinking about it afterwards, isn’t the kind of optimization going on with social media actually distorted-looking? (Followed by whatever optimization the advertisers do to get you to do what they want, which I guess is of a kind with what they have always done, so at least not a new experimental horror.) I actually don’t really know. And maybe it isn’t a bright distinction.</p>

<p>Maybe optimization for you <em>clicking</em> on ads should be a different category (i.e. ‘distorted-clicking’). This seems close to distorted-looking, in that it isn’t directly seeking to manipulate your behavior outside of your phone session, but a big step closer to distorted-acting, since you have been set off toward whatever you have ultimately been targeted to buy.</p>

<p>I was at first thinking that distorted-looking was safer than distorted-acting. But distorted-looking forces probably do also distort your opinions and actions. For instance, as the film suggested, you are likely to look more if you get interested in something that there is a lot of content on, or something that upsets you and traps your attention.</p>

<p>I could imagine distorted-looking actually being worse than distorted-acting: when your opinion can be bought, the change in it is presumably what someone would want. Whereas when your opinion is manipulated as a weird side effect of someone trying to get you to look more, then it could be any random thing, which might be terrible.(Or would there be such weird side effects in both cases anyway?)</p>

        <span class="post-meta">Oct 23, 2020</span>
        <p>Some confusing facts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/10/22/P100-PSA.html">P100 masks plausibly increase the safety of activities by a factor of a hundred</a>, if worn correctly, which can’t be that hard.

  <li>P100 masks cost about $60 (or $30 pre-pandemic, if I recall), and a single one can be reused indefinitely</li>
  <li>Lots of people are greatly constrained in what they do by covid risk.</li>
  <li>I have seen almost no discussion of or interest in P100s. It took me a bit of searching to even figure out if they were helpful, since the internet was so disinterested in the topic.</li>
</ul>

<p>What gives?</p>

<p>My P100 is a fairly central tool in my own do-things-while-avoiding-covid strategy. I wear it almost whenever I go inside away from home, which isn’t as rare as it would be if I didn’t have it. I still don’t feel comfortable enough to just spend ages indoors with other people, and it doesn’t help much with eating or talking heavy activities (I find it hard to talk audibly through it, though other people are fine at this). Yet there are lots of other risky activities, and still I rarely see anyone else wearing one, except for my friends, for whom P100s also play a central role. I do see other people taking risks seriously——for instance avoiding flying, or quarantining after flying——yet on a plane, everyone is wearing surgical masks at best. Why don’t people pay $60 and drastically reduce the risks?</p>

<p>Here are some good use cases for wearing a P100:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Indoor medical appointments (I have been on a bunch of these during covid, mostly to freeze my eggs)</li>
  <li>Flying in planes (I did this once)</li>
  <li>Taking Ubers (I’ve done this a lot)</li>
  <li>Being in busy waiting rooms (I did this waiting for a train, on board of which I had a roomette)</li>
  <li>If I had an indoor or public facing job that didn’t involve talking primarily, such as shopping for Instacart or being a kitchenhand, I’d hope to wear a P100, though I might be missing details of such jobs that would make it hard. (I do find my mask uncomfortable to wear for many hours in a row, but I am unusually prone to getting headaches from things touching my head.)</li>
  <li>Voting in person when unsure if this will mean waiting around indoors with other people (I actually don’t know what this is like, I’m not a US citizen)</li>
</ul>

<p>(Note that airlines and at least some fertility clinics don’t allow masks with valves in general, because they don’t protect other people. To make a P100 prosocial, wear a surgical mask over the outflow valve. Airlines accept this most but not all of the time, according to anecdotes.)</p>

<p>But anyway, what gives?</p>

        <p>If I understand, a well fitted P100 mask might increase the covid-safety of activities by a factor of about a hundred (though note <strong>well fitted</strong>, and I’m unclear on how hard it is to fit them perfectly, or on how good they are if not—I treat it as a smaller factor).</p>

<p>For instance, from <a href="microcovid.org">microcovid.org</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>-A P100 is even better. Since P100s are generally not used in medical settings, there isn’t the sort of research that would let one state a protection factor under typical use with any kind of confidence. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24011377/">One study</a> found P100s to filter out a virus aerosol at their stated 99.97% filtration efficiency, but at those levels your risk probably starts to be dominated by previously-small effects like surface transmission and getting virus in your eyes. We think that under ideal conditions, the risk reduction with a P100 might plausibly be as high as 100x compared to no mask, but we’re really not sure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Note that the study they cite is not about covid in particular.)</p>

<p>A factor of a hundred makes many otherwise fraught activities fairly innocuous, e.g. <a href="https://www.microcovid.org/?distance=sixFt&amp;duration=360&amp;interaction=oneTime&amp;personCount=20&amp;riskProfile=average&amp;setting=indoor&amp;subLocation=US_06075&amp;theirMask=basic&amp;topLocation=US_06&amp;voice=silent&amp;yourMask=filtered">going on a plane</a> scaled down by a factor of a hundred would seem to be much safer than going to a supermarket. I have been treating it as a much smaller factor than a hundred due to pessimism about my wearing the mask correctly, and uncertainty due to my limited research on this, but still, it’s hugely helpful.</p>

<p>Furthermore, P100 masks cost $30-$100 and are designed to be reused a lot of times. You can currently buy the GVS Elipse, recommended by <a href="microcovid.org">microcovid.org</a> and also me, on Ebay.</p>

<p>Other interesting notes, from <a href="microcovid.org">microcovid.org</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>-P100s are easier to test the seal on. You can search for online training on how to do this.
-Note that P100 respirators typically have an outflow valve, meaning they provide minimal protection to others from you, so if you take this route, you should at least cover the outflow valve with a surgical mask.</p>

        <p>People often tell me that they don’t like San Francisco, especially of late. It’s dirty, or depressing, or has the wrong vibe, or is full of people who think it is reasonable to ban straws, or is the epitome of some kind of sinister social failing. Which are all plausible complaints.</p>

<p>I’m reminded of this thought from <em><a href="http://www.leaderu.com/cyber/books/orthodoxy/ch5.html">Orthodoxy</a></em>, by G. K. Chesterton, which my boyfriend and I have been meanderingly reading in recent months:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let us suppose we are confronted with a desperate thing – say Pimlico. If we think what is really best for Pimlico we shall find the thread of thought leads to the throne or the mystic and the arbitrary. It is not enough for a man to disapprove of Pimlico: in that case he will merely cut his throat or move to Chelsea. Nor, certainly, is it enough for a man to approve of Pimlico: for then it will remain Pimlico, which would be awful. The only way out of it seems to be for somebody to love Pimlico: to love it with a transcendental tie and without any earthly reason. If there arose a man who loved Pimlico, then Pimlico would rise into ivory towers and golden pinnacles; Pimlico would attire herself as a woman does when she is loved. For decoration is not given to hide horrible things: but to decorate things already adorable. A mother does not give her child a blue bow because he is so ugly without it. A lover does not give a girl a necklace to hide her neck. If men loved Pimlico as mothers love children, arbitrarily, because it is theirs, Pimlico in a year or two might be fairer than Florence. Some readers will say that this is a mere fantasy. I answer that this is the actual history of mankind. This, as a fact, is how cities did grow great. Go back to the darkest roots of civilization and you will find them knotted round some sacred stone or encircling some sacred well. People first paid honour to a spot and afterwards gained glory for it. Men did not love Rome because she was great. She was great because they had loved her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is not to say either that I think people should pour their energy into awful cities, or that San Francisco is the kind of awful city that might prompt the question of whether they should. But I do wonder if there is something missing in the usual attitude. In everyone moving here, assessing what the city gives them, and finding it either sufficient or lacking.</p>

<p>One thing is that the city is largely people. Who do you expect to make it good? It’s not true that you should stay at parties that aren’t fun, but you are missing something if you show up at parties to sit at the side judging before going on to the next one.</p>

<p>At Burning Man it is clearer that whatever the social scene is, you and others are making it. If it is more others than you, why are you so powerless? Maybe there are just a lot of others, and they don’t want the same things as you. In which case, a fair time to leave for another camp. But if you are an observer puzzled at why ‘they’ don’t do things better, then consider that you are ‘they’, as much as anyone.</p>

<p>I’m open to the possibility that contributing to the goodness of your city is not a worthy use of effort, if you have more important projects going on, and you abide by laws and pay your taxes. But I don’t take it for granted, and similar views seem probably wrong—for instance it seems like an error not to contribute to your household being good, or your family being good, or your friendships and relationships being good. A city is bigger, so it might be tempting to succumb to tragedy of the commons—no helped stranger will likely benefit you enough to make the help worth your while selfishly. But averting tragedies of the commons is better than suffering them, if possible.</p>

<p>On a different and non-prescriptive note, the same place is different if you love it. I have a friend who appears to relentlessly like San Francisco. And San Francisco is better going around with him. It’s a place of bright parks and hidden shops, fresh bread and rich coffee, characters, corridors for riding, singing in the street, culture, stories, poetry. I don’t necessarily recommend people go around loving things they don’t love for the sheer experiential benefits of it, but it seems worth noting.</p>

          </a>
        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Oct 20, 2020</span>
        <p>The other day I had a dentist appointment, and as an alternative to focusing on whether or not it was currently unpleasant, I tried to become interested in American politics.</p>

<p>It’s not that American politics fails to be attention-grabbing. But a casserole falling on the floor is attention grabbing, and I wouldn’t say that I’m interested in falling casseroles. I do read about the political situation, but like a casserole-fall viewer, mostly with curiosity and responsive dismay, not with real intellectual engagement or fertile thinking. Why?</p>

<p>Politics is important, from what I can gather. And detailed. And probably involves all kinds of normally intellectually gratifying constructions such as game theory, strategy and institution design. So shouldn’t it be interesting?</p>

<p>I think it doesn’t seem interesting because I have the impression of it being broadly ridiculous, and as a consequence, somehow not my problem. An analogy: in my current house, I am usually plenty interested in perfecting the finer details of our system of household responsibilities. But if I joined a new house, and they told me that they determined who was going to wash up based on a weekly basketball tournament combined with an astrological reading, I wouldn’t be intellectually gripped by the finer questions of how the basketball tournament should be run, or how different people were doing in the game.</p>

<p>Or relatedly, it feels too far from making sense to me to engage my intellectual curiosity. If someone was trying to find a good route North to Seattle, I’d be more compelled to join them in the question than if they were trying to find a good route North to New Zealand or Mars.</p>

<p>When I say it seems ridiculous or nonsensical, here are some things I’m thinking of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>if you wanted to determine the best policies to adopt across a huge number of issues, voting to choose a small group of people to decide them all, out of a moderately larger pool of people, based on a combination of a few issues that seem salient at the time, plus the candidate’s vibes, social prowess, and susceptibility to public embarrassment, doesn’t seem like a thing you should even expect to work.</li>
  <li>Continual overt lying isn’t a deal breaker in the highest office</li>
  <li>Debate of the kind where you discuss the answer to some question <a href="/2020-10-08-punishment-for-forgotten-norms.md">doesn’t seem to be part of</a> presidential debates</li>
  <li>Things I would usually think of as basic are not assumed in public debate. For instance, that the ‘personal freedom’ we might agree to uphold isn’t prima facie going to include freedom to harm other people by giving them covid.</li>
  <li>Something something QAnon?</li>
</ul>

<p>This is all an account of my previously unexamined feelings, and on examination, I don’t endorse them.</p>

<p>For one thing, the sense that something isn’t my problem because it is silly doesn’t make sense. Where does it come from? Perhaps that at a smaller scale, if a thing is too silly, it is often best to disengage. If a club has lots of stupid rules, you should usually leave rather than trying to overhaul it; if a restaurant won’t let you eat without discussing the proprietor’s confusing personal conflicts at length, the standard response is to find a different restaurant rather than trying to workshop your relationship with this proprietor. But there aren’t other Americas to go to, and this one has plenty of influence over all kinds of important things, so this heuristic doesn’t apply at all.</p>

<p>But at another level, my sense that things are ridiculous in a way that might negate my identifying with them or caring about them seems wrong. Everything is part of the world, and there are real reasons it came about, that would make sense on the most complete and true theory of things. It is my world, and if I am to contend with and understand it, then that includes the curling of Donald Trump’s lips as much as much as the flocking of swallows, the unfolding of logic, or the spiraling of galaxies.</p>

        <p>A draft post from a year ago that I didn’t put up then, about a problem that I had forgotten about:</p>

<p><em>I recently woke up, and do not appear to be aggressively pursuing anything worthwhile, for instance understanding the future of artificial intelligence, or trading my precariously slung dressing gown for more versatile writing attire. I did make some coffee, but am falling down on actually drinking it, and it is on the other side of the room, so that might be a thing for later.</em></p>

<p><em>My impression has been for a while that I am just a worse human in the morning, and then gradually improve toward the evening. Such that I can spend hours incrementally trying to direct my attention toward some task and carefully reflecting on why it’s not working and how to improve the situation in the afternoon, and then just do it without problems after about 8pm.</em></p>

<p><em>I’d like to figure out what’s so great about the evening, so I can have more of it in the morning. But a problem with my impressions are that they are very vague. It is pretty unclear to me what exactly goes wrong earlier in the day. I can’t point to things and say ‘aha, five instances of bad thing before noon, and none later in the day’. And looking at my own mind at a particular moment, I can’t easily say it is in one state or another, though I often have the sense over the day that it did get somehow better.</em></p>

<p><em>(Mental states are tricky—it seems to me that for some of them you can internally point at a quality of it that is clearly there or not, but for other axes the change is more subtle. Like watching a film you can instantly tell if it changed to being in black and white, but it is harder and slower to tell if it changed to really emphasizing Bob’s point of view at the expense of Sally’s.)</em></p>

<p><em>I could perhaps log my time using Toggl and look for patterns in what time of day work blocks are, but there are a lot of confounders, like the fact that official work time is in the day and popularly coordinated on social time is in the evening. Or for whatever reason, it feels a bit hopeless.</em></p>

<p><em>Given that it is early in the day and I do at least feel like writing, I thought I’d write down what it is like somewhat, so that I can compare to later.</em></p>

<p><em>Here are some features of my experience</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>I can’t easily remember if I finished my morning routine as much as I intended. If I did, there was a long while where I had the sense that there was more of it to do, but wasn’t really focused on it.
I have a sense of a stack of things that I have intended to do, and set aside repeatedly, that I should go back to. I woke up and got various messages, which I meant to deal with later, but at least one was a person asking me ‘if I had had a chance to look at’ a thing I should probably look at imminently. Then I was doing my morning routine, which I have probably finished (ok, on consideration, I did finish it), but in the process I made some coffee that I should drink. I saw that I should do washing up and take out the trash. And maybe clean up my room, sometime soon. I started to plan my day, which I do every morning, but for some reason do not consider part of my morning routine. Before I finished planning, I started to write to ask someone to help me with an important thing, but then decided I should do it later and finish planning first. I was feeling unwell a few minutes ago, so maybe I should do something about that. I had intended to go to the other room to work, but now I’m not—should I go back? I had intended to ask my housemate if I could use his desk while he’s away. I need to go to the bathroom. Now I’m writing this. There is another larger scale problem in the back of my mind that I wonder if I should do something about. And another one.</em></li>
  <li><em>My heart is beating hard, and at about 110bmp apparently. I can see it moving my stomach. I feel a sense of urgency from nowhere.</em></li>
  <li><em>I am cold. The house is bright, but feels uninspiring.</em></li>
  <li><em>I don’t know what I want to do next. There are some mundane tasks, which I expect to take a long time for no apparent reason, and which I feel some revulsion around. I expect doing them to waste the day, and leave me with a similarly insurmountable pile of mundane tasks, and one fewer day. There are some more important projects, which I expect to take an obscenely long time for no apparent reason, and be unsatisfying, and then if I finish them, for other people to find them unremarkable, especially since finishing them probably involves lowering my standards a lot. I feel less averse to these, but trepidatious.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<p><em>During the making of this list I wandered off and did something else multiple times</em></p>

<p><em>Seeing what I have written, a natural hypothesis is that too many things are going on and slightly occupy my attention, and I’m responding by being overwhelmed rather than organizing them and focusing on one. If this situation is different to later in the day, it could be that the onslaught of things is different somehow or that my own adeptness at organizing them and picking one is different. My current hypothesis is that the organizing them and picking one task is less natural and harder now, because my attention is hard to keep on one thing, and everything seems a little bit aversive and hard to deal with instead of a little bit appealing.</em></p>

<p><em>I’ll check further by trying to organize the tasks.</em></p>

<p>~</p>

<p><em>Ok, well notably I didn’t do that. I put on clothes, then I responded to messages, then I looked at the internet. I will try again.</em></p>

<p>~</p>

<p><em>While planning my day, other notes on what goes wrong:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>I have the background sense that someone expects me to do something, which is encumbering and uncomfortable. I think this might be fairly destructive. (I have previously thought that a nice thing about working at 4am or so is that everyone who might be expecting anything of you is asleep.) My guess is that running an organization doesn’t help with this, because for instance my employees expect me to meet with them, look at their work, be at work, respond to their messages. Also, other people expect my organization to produce useful things. If this were a big deal, it would predict things got radically better between about 5pm and 8pm, when people stop being at work or thinking that you might be, and better again at about 1am when people stop being awake. It would also predict that if I do the things that most obviously someone might be expecting me to do, things get better. I’ll try doing them first.</em></li>
  <li><em>The plan for my day would naturally include a bunch of small tasks that I feel averse to, though each in itself doesn’t seem bad. It is more the sense that they will eat the day, and I can’t get into anything. So I got a sheet of paper and wrote down many such things, especially the ones where it doesn’t really matter if it doesn’t happen this time (for instance, tidying my room, doing my laundry). My plan is to do them as breaks, but not for them to be a main focus of attention. This feels better somehow, I think because I can singlemindedly direct myself at one important thing at a time.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<p><em>Ok, I made a plan. I feel like it took a long time, and involved various drifting off and doing other things. Now I have four or so small aversive tasks to do, and then I can get to the main deal. If I want a break, I have a list of non-compulsory ideas.</em></p>

<p><em>Current hypotheses about key intermediate factors between early hours and worseness:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Number of incoming things to do or attend to</em></li>
  <li><em>Tendency to find arbitrary things offputting instead of nice</em></li>
  <li><em>Ease of directing attention</em></li>
  <li><em>Sense that people are expecting something of me</em></li>
  <li><em>Light</em></li>
  <li><em>Biological factor to do with recency of sleep</em></li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<p><em>I shall consider this again later in the day.</em></p>

<p><em>One hope about letting people see bits of my life in detail is that they will notice that particular bits seem much more stupid than in their own lives. Like one time my friend noticed that I didn’t know that WiFi was all around us, and showed me how to turn it on. Or <a href="https://meteuphoric.com/2016/06/26/are-you-missing-universal-human-skills/">one time</a>, my boyfriend at the time noticed that I don’t know how to cut or chew meat, and showed me how. So comments expressing disbelief that I don’t do things in an obviously better way are especially welcome (in general, not just on this post).</em></p>

        <span class="post-meta">Oct 18, 2020</span>
        <p>I live in San Francisco. Some people I know are worried about living in US cities at election time because of the potential for political unrest. This seems surprising to me, since I figure the chance of rioting harming a specific person in a large city is very low, especially if that person takes the precaution of not being intentionally at a riot. If I thought the chance of a riot so incredibly huge and destructive that one in a thousand people in my city is killed is as high as one in a thousand, that is still only giving me around a one in a million chance of death, i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromort#Travel">similar to</a> the risk from a flight to New York. Possibly I’m not being imaginative enough.</p>

<p>To check I’m not just badly mistaken about riots, I looked a bit for particularly bad previous riots in the United States. The 1863 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_draft_riots">New York City draft riots</a> is the disaster with the largest death toll listed as a ‘riot’ in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_disasters_in_the_United_States_by_death_toll">this list of US disasters by death toll</a>. Wikipedia lists it as involving the death of around 120 people (though someone argues 2,000<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>), and the population at the time was apparently <a href="http://physics.bu.edu/~redner/projects/population/cities/newyork.html">813,669</a>, so that’s around a one in ten thousand mortality rate of city residents. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_Newark_riots">1967 Newark riots</a> were also mentioned somewhere as especially bad, and seem to have involved a similar death rate of city residents. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots">1992 Los Angeles riots</a> involved 62 deaths, from a population of about 3.5M, which is a one in fifty thousand chance of death per resident. This wasn’t a very in depth review, but seems to support my view that a riot which killed one in one thousand residents in a city would be very surprising (e.g. would probably be the deadliest riot in US history). It seems fairly unlikely that this election involves the deadliest riot in US history at all, and if it did, unlikely that such a riot occurs in my particular city, and even if it did, a resident might then have a one in a thousand chance of death, ignoring probably a large further factor of safety for not joining a riot.</p>

<p>What am I missing?</p>

        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Oct 16, 2020</span>
        <p>I found a poem in my Google docs from 2012, seemingly pasted there from an obsolete document system of even earlier. I couldn’t find it anywhere else on the internet, and I seem to have multiple slightly different versions of it in my docs, and also some related notes. Which all suggests that I wrote it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this seems implausible. It’s not just that I don’t remember writing it, which would be pretty unsurprising. But I don’t remember having the thoughts that are in it, or being the kind of person who would write it. For instance, I think the author has substantially more poetry writing skill than me and substantially less desire to be over-the-top existential than early-twenties me. And while it’s unfinished, this appears to be intentional. And there is a kind of person who would call a thing Endless and then not give it an end, and I thought that that person was someone else. Not that I necessarily object to them. One plausible explanation is that one of my ex-boyfriends wrote it, but the only likely candidate doesn’t recognize it either.</p>

<p>I didn’t like it that much at first. It took me several read-throughs to even understand it. But I kept wanting to re-read it and liking it more. And it sticks in my mind. Now I quite like it, and also especially feel like I get the person who wrote it. And I still can’t figure out if it was me. (Do I get them more because they are me? Or I am sympathetic to a writer I imagine might be me? Would I like it more or less if I knew the answer? I think maybe less if it were resolved in either direction.)</p>

<p>Anyway, here’s a poem I like; origin unknown:</p>

<p><strong>Endless</strong></p>

<p><em>I am your photo, un-adore<br />
this laughing play and lively dance<br />
All strands of magic yours before<br />
Perfection through dull mirror glanced<br />
No rapt’rous thing not yours alone<br />
If we meet, binding, one our night.<br />
What wonder radiant eyes enthrone,<br />
In days encrusted by your light,<br />
Can walk this strangled endless scene<br />
Of narrow moments, reaching past<br />
for one to drown them in between<br />
all fleeting stillness, blind their farce.<br />
To not come, resolution waits,<br />
don’t let me near you, to my dream,<br />
It’s all I have,</em></p>

<p>On considering the existence of seals more, I came to wonder how this body design—short plump fur snake with weirdly placed flipper limbs, apparently optimized for being extremely cute while lying in one place—could possibly evolve in a world where animal dexterity can get pretty high, e.g. also leopards exist, and there is just no good reason for them to be cute. After minor YouTube investigation, I think a) seals are not somehow surprisingly agile on land; b) seals live in water, where this seems to be an excellent body design; c) penguins and seals are fairly similarly shaped water creatures, but in their awkward land phase, rest on different edges.</p>

        <p>Being grateful is often suggested as a good and scientific way to raise some kind of wellbeing measure. Probably somehow resulting from that, and from my much greater enjoyment of being grateful than of investigating this claim at all, sometimes I embark on a concerted effort to be grateful for specific things.</p>

<p>However I am sometimes confused about directing gratitude, in a similar way to how I am confused about considering things ‘problems’. Is there a problem—never spoken of but so much bigger than anything that ever is—of everyone not being able to access vast quantities of wisdom and pleasure by pressing their belly buttons?</p>

<p>Maybe I should be grateful that the horsehead nebula isn’t a real horsehead?</p>

<p>I’m inclined to say that something in the vicinity of the problem thing is a real problem, because ways the world could be better that are not ‘problems’ are probably relatively ignored, what with the popularity of solving problems. But that sentence was somewhat self-undermining, in that upon recognizing a way that the world might be better (we might notice ways the world could be better that don’t correspond to ‘problems’) I declared the absence of the good thing a problem. Maybe that’s what people usually do, so in fact any plausible improvement becomes a ‘problem’?</p>

<p>I have the impression that that there is much more interest in healing diseases than in making normal people even better, physically or mentally. Which seems like evidence for attention going to ‘problems’ disproportionately. But I think it could easily be explained by valuing of equality between people, or just by the general ease of progress via fixing broken things over progress via treading new ground.</p>

<p>I tentatively suppose that a trick with gratitude is to not aim for it to be evenly distributed across a sensically understood space of gratitude deserving entities. Instead focus on whatever actually inspires appreciation. It’s ok to be grateful for the horsehead nebula thing, your phone and gravity and to call it quits. That said, I have no idea, and welcome views from anyone more informed about the proper having of gratitude.</p>

<p>Some things I am grateful for tonight:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Other people putting up with lonely, hard, hopeless-seeming times, and trying to look after themselves even when it doesn’t feel worth much.</li>
  <li>People who take roles where they have to make high stakes decisions in real time, and who are also properly sensible to those stakes.</li>
  <li>Everyone involved in providing me with toast with raspberry jam and butter</li>
  <li>The logical structure of possibility</li>
  <li>Round seals, and whatever inconveniences and deprivations they suffer in gracing the world with round seals.</li>
</ul>

        <span class="post-meta">Oct 13, 2020</span>
        <p>In London at the start of the year, perhaps there was more advertising than there usually is in my life, because I found its presence disgusting and upsetting. Could I not use public transport without having my mind intruded upon continually by trite performative questions?</p>

<p><img src="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/assets/eendra-underground-ads.jpg" alt="London underground" style="margin:25px 0px" /></p>

<p>Sometimes I fantasize about a future where stealing someone’s attention to suggest for the fourteenth time that they watch your awful-looking play is rightly looked upon as akin to picking their pocket.</p>

<p>Stepping back, advertising is widely found to be a distasteful activity. But I think it is helpful to distinguish the different unpleasant flavors potentially involved (and often not involved—there is good advertising):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mind manipulation</strong>: Advertising is famous for uncooperatively manipulating people’s beliefs and values in whatever way makes them more likely to pay money somehow. For instance, deceptively encouraging the belief that everyone uses a certain product, or trying to spark unwanted wants.</p>

    <p><img src="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/assets/markham-ad-paint.jpg" alt="Painting an ad" style="margin:25px 0px" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Zero-sumness</strong>: To the extent advertising is aimed at raising the name recognition and thus market share of one product over its similar rivals, it is zero or negative sum: burning effort on both sides and the attention of the customer for no overall value.</p>

    <p><img src="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/assets/subiyanto-nestle-ad.jpg" height="495" /> <img src="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/assets/weir-coke-ad.jpg" height="495" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Theft of a precious thing</strong>: Attention is arguably one of the best things you have, and its protection arguably worthy of great effort. In cases where it is vulnerable—for instance because you are outside and so do not personally control everything you might look at or hear—advertising is the shameless snatching of it. This might be naively done, in the same way that a person may naively steal silverware assuming that it is theirs to take because nothing is stopping them.</p>

    <p><img src="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/assets/williamsantos-underground.png" alt="London underground" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cultural poison</strong>: Culture and the common consciousness are an organic dance of the multitude of voices and experiences in society. In the name of advertising, huge amounts of effort and money flow into amplifying fake voices, designed to warp perceptions–and therefore the shared world–to ready them for exploitation. Advertising can be a large fraction of the voices a person hears. It can draw social creatures into its thin world. And in this way, it goes beyond manipulating the minds of those who listen to it. Through those minds it can warp the whole shared world, even for those who don’t listen firsthand. Advertising shifts your conception of what you can do, and what other people are doing, and what you should pay attention to. It presents role models, designed entirely for someone else’s profit. It saturates the central gathering places with inanity, as long as that might sell something.</p>

    <p><img src="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/assets/geib-ads.jpg" alt="Outdoor ads over darkened figures" style="margin:25px 0px" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Market failure</strong>: Ideally, whoever my attention is worth most to would get it, regardless of whether it was initially stolen. For instance, if I have better uses for my attention than advertising, hopefully I will pay more to have it back than the advertiser expects to make by advertising to me. So we will be able to make a trade, and I’ll get my attention back. In practice this is probably too complicated, since so many tiny transactions are needed. E.g. the best message for me to see, if I have to see a message, when sitting on a train, is probably something fairly different from what I do see. It is also probably worth me paying a small sum to each person who would advertise at me to just see a blank wall instead. But it is hard for them to collect that money from each person. And in cases where the advertiser was just a random attention thief and didn’t have some special right to my attention, if I were to pay one to leave me alone, another one might immediately replace them.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

    <p><img src="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/assets/clear-ad-wu.jpg" alt="Underground ads over crowd" style="margin:25px 0px" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ugliness</strong>: At the object level, advertising is often clearly detracting from the beauty of a place.</p>

    <p><img src="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/assets/negspace-ads.jpg" alt="Ads overwhelming buildings" style="margin:25px 0px" /></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These aren’t necessarily distinct—to the extent ugliness is bad, say, one might expect that it is related to some market failure. But they are different reasons for disliking a thing-a person can hate something ugly while having no strong view on the perfection of ideal markets.</p>

<p>What would good and ethical advertising look like? Maybe I decide that I want to be advertised to now, and go to my preferred advertising venue. I see a series of beautiful messages about things that are actively helpful for me to know. I can downvote ads if I don’t like the picture of the world that they are feeding into my brain, or the apparent uncooperativeness of their message. I leave advertising time feeling inspired and happy.</p>

        <p>Among people, I tend far toward liking to organize things, to make detailed plans, to conceive of my actions as within some sensical framework, etc. I appreciate that all this might be bad, but it is at least very compelling to me.</p>

<p>Among people with these kinds of traits, my guess is that I am unusual in how often when typing something into a todo list or writing it on a whiteboard, I vaguely wish that the task instead involved moving around a bunch of rocks, possibly organized into little heaps.</p>

        <p>I have never been an enthusiastic bed-goer, because I like life. But a nice thing about going to bed is that you can be confident that you are doing roughly the best thing. At noon, the smallness of the chance that your chosen task is really among the best ways to spend your precious moments in this world might be discouraging or oppressive. Perhaps you would only have to be a tiny bit smarter or think a bit longer to be able to recognize that this is the wrong way and that you could be doing much better. But at 4am, sleeping is probably pretty close to the most valuable thing.</p>

        <span class="post-meta">Oct 11, 2020</span>
        <p>Today I watched some YouTube videos about the World Wars, and in particular how the first one came about. It did seem like a sequence of plausible sounding steps that led to a giant war. But there is an abstract level at which I still feel confused. Which is one where initially there are basically a very large number of humans who each very much don’t want to die presumably, most of whom have very little reason to kill almost any of the others. Then somehow this all turns into everyone putting huge amounts of effort in and risking their lives to kill each other. It is as if you told me that you had a barn full of soaking wet hay, and it turned into a big bonfire.</p>

<p>I suppose the natural explanation is that there are rulers, or in more game theoretic terms to match the incentive-level of my confusion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some people start out in pre-arranged relationships of control over others, so that they can insist that those people risk their lives to do things that they don’t otherwise care about, e.g. kill strangers. In particular, the controllers can otherwise punish the soldiers-to-be harshly. They can do this because societies generally have an arrangement where anyone can be punished for failing to follow the rules, including whatever the leader says (e.g. ‘we are going to war now’) and the rules about upholding of punishments. This means individuals can end up doing things that are overall costly for them, because their leader can impose a larger cost if they don’t do it. If people succumb to such threats, the threats don’t need to be carried out often, and so it can be cheap for those in control to ask a large number of controlled people to do things otherwise strongly against their interests. (e.g. a government can extract far more in taxes from a population than the cost of incentivizing them to pay taxes.) So this equilibrium is fairly stable, though we haven’t considered alternate sources of threats (e.g. another party saying they will punish you if you listen to the ruler).</li>
  <li>Once you have large groups controlled by decisionmakers who don’t suffer the costs of their decisions, it becomes unsurprising if the outcome is massive costs to almost everyone concerned with little gained by anyone.</li>
  <li>You might only need one such controller of others to prefer war, as long as the others or their citizens consider it worth defending from the attack.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t know how much this explains though. And there are probably other things going on. For instance, <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-soldiers-across-europe-who-were-excited-about-world-war-i-29807">here’s</a> Winston Churchill in 1914:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everything tends towards catastrophe and collapse. I am interested, geared up and happy. It is not horrible to be built like that? The preparations have a hideous fascination for me. I pray to God to forgive me for such fearful moods of levity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in 1916:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think a curse should rest on me – because I love this war. I know it’s smashing and shattering the lives of thousands every moment and yet, I can’t help it, I enjoy every second of it.</p>
</blockquote>

        <p>Today I read about ancient history instead of doing work. Which got me thinking about Santorini.</p>

<p>If you see blue-domed chapels with whitewashed walls perched idyllically over the Aegean sea, there is a good chance you’ve got yourself (a picture of) Santorini.<!--more--></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/santorini.jpg" alt="Santorini" /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Such pictures got a new flavor for me when I realized that the wide circular bay these buildings overlook is actually the caldera of a massive volcano. The flavor is similar to the one they would have if the cliffs resolved into the eyelids of a giant looking up beneath the waves.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/Santorini_Landsat.jpg" alt="Santorini from above" /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>When I say the volcano is large, I don’t mean I know anything about the usual distribution of volcano sizes. Just that I can zoom out on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Santorini/@36.4072715,25.3504186,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x1499ce86adfd9ff7:0xb2a761f740d68afc!8m2!3d36.3931562!4d25.4615092">Google maps</a> almost enough to see the whole of Greece, and still make out the lip of this volcano.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/santorinigreece.png" alt="Santorini and Greece" /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The volcano was responsible for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_eruption">Minoan eruption</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_large_volcanic_eruptions">one of the biggest volcanic eruptions</a> in the last twenty thousand years, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_eruption#Minoan_civilization">possibly</a> the downfall of Minoa. It unsurprisingly destroyed the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrotiri_(prehistoric_city)">Akrotiri</a> which is actually on Santorini. Very surprisingly to me, it didn’t destroy it that much, such that it is an exciting archeological site (note that I have no expertise, and am going only by my evidently wrong imagination for what happens if melted rock comes out of a hole that big with enough force to go anywhere). Also surprisingly to me, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrotiri_(prehistoric_city)#Excavations">it seems</a> to have been successfully evacuated, with practically nobody killed in the blast.</p>

<p>If you asked me to predict how well I would do living on the island rim of an underwater volcano sixteen hundred years before the birth of Christ, on the unlucky occasion of it erupting intensely, I would have guessed ‘very badly’. Apparently the buildings of Akrotiri were often several stories high and some had indoor water-flushing toilets though, so it seems they had their shit together much more than I would have expected.</p>

            The mystery of the fall of the Bronze Age
          </a>
        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Oct 9, 2020</span>
        <p>This evening my boyfriend and I decided we would like to learn about the fall of the Bronze Age. Really he wanted to learn about the World Wars or the rise of communism, but I pointed out that to understand WWI you probably want to know what was going on just before it, and that I would be willing to only ride this slippery slope as far as the Bronze Age, and that the Bronze Age collapse was pretty interesting. Admittedly I also wanted to learn about a period of history that had at most one of carnage and photography.</p>

<p>The basic situation with the end of the Bronze Age, as I remember hearing it, is this. There were about nine thriving civilizations around the Mediterranean Sea leading up to 1200BC. They had palaces and grand monuments and written records and ships carrying perfume and metals and grapes and letters about. It was going pretty well. Then in a matter of decades, they were all destroyed or drastically diminished. Basically every major city in some large area was ruined and often abandoned forever.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The big mystery of it is what happened. In spite of us having earlier records for events like <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/the-first-return-in-history-from-nearly-4-000-years-ago/136283">Hammurabi returning</a> a pair of sandals, it seems that this early try at an interconnected civilized world came to an end without leaving conclusive evidence about what the problem was. There is writing of ‘sea people’ attacking cities, and evidence of drought and famine, earthquakes and violence. But which, if any, of these really caused it is an open question.</p>

<p>A mystery that we discovered tonight is that there aren’t any good looking documentaries about this around. It was easy enough—and incredible, let me say—to watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Wild_Country">a documentary</a> about that time a religious commune tried to start a city in rural Oregon, but there are only a couple of neglected videos on obscure websites about what I’m told is one of the most intense civilizational disintegrations ever.</p>

<p>We ended up watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRcu-ysocX4">expert Eric Cline give a lecture about it</a> instead. It was pretty interesting, though I think we have disagreements about epistemology. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Highlights for me included seeing the <a href="https://www.pinterest.cl/pin/562668547186510361/">neat parcels of glass</a> dredged up from a trading ship wrecked 3400 years ago, and hearing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugaritic_texts">concerned letters from the time</a> <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> . The continuity of familiar human experience—molding substances and transporting them around, anguish, asking for help—so far back into the mist of civilizational dawn that the requests are pressed into clay tablets, is inspiriting in spite of the hardness of the experiences.</p>

        <p>I watched some of the vice-presidential debate tonight, in an act of uncharacteristic attention to politics. Which is to say, it’s not a kind of game I am familiar with the finer details of. Early on, one of the debaters was given two minutes to answer what sounded like an easy question, and proceeded to just openly and brazenly not answer it and instead talk about how bad the other party was for nearly the whole time in such an overt fashion that I felt embarrassed for them. They answered at the end, technically but not very informatively.</p>

<p>My first impulse was to hold this against them. But my caricatured impression of politics plus my boyfriend’s amusement at my indignation suggest that not answering the question is to political debate as running on grass is to soccer. So even if we have some broader norms suggesting that one should answer the question in such circumstances-or should have such norms—still these debaters have no reason to expect viewers to hold it against them if they don’t answer the question. And given that, and the importance of winning, shouldn’t they, morally, totally ignore the question, whenever there is something more politically advantageous to say? And then shouldn’t I not be annoyed, and in fact fully support that, since they acted morally?</p>

<p>That all sounds plausible, in a way. But suppose it is definitely genuinely worse for the world for debaters not to answer the question. And the social costs from people like me (but eligible to vote) thinking worse of them are the very thing that determines whether or not they answer the question. That makes it seem right for me to punish them. So should I rightly punish them, while they rightly do the thing I’m punishing them for (and I agree that they are right)? Should they agree that I should punish them, while also thinking that they should go ahead and do it?</p>

<p><span style="color:grey"><em>Or we could finish reading that George Saunders essay?</em></span></p>

<p>We finished it-‘Stay open, forever, so open it hurts, and then open up some more, until the day you die, world without end, amen.’ Remember?
<!--more--></p>

<p><span style="color:grey"><em>Oh yeah. Alright then.</em></span></p>

<p>Pastoral <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>When I was younger<br />
it was plain to me<br />
I must make something of myself.<br />
Older now<br />
I walk the back streets<br />
admiring the houses<br />
of the very poor:<br />
roof out of line with sides<br />
the yards cluttered<br />
with old chicken wire, ashes,<br />
furniture gone wrong;<br />
the fences and outhouses<br />
built of barrel-staves<br />
and parts of boxes, all,<br />
if I am fortunate,<br />
smeared a bluish green<br />
that properly weathered<br />
pleases me best
of all colors.</p>

<p>No one<br />
will believe this<br />
of vast import to the nation.</p>

<p>…Hmm</p>

<p>I suppose it is something to do with honoring the poor, —</p>

<p><span style="color:grey"><em>Nah-— sorry, go on.</em></span></p>

<p>Hmm?</p>

<p><span style="color:grey"><em>You first!</em></span></p>

<p>Well, when he was young, he thought that making something of himself—being rich and successful—was where it was at. But now here he is among the vast detail of the poor, and he realizes that the world is big, and this is important.</p>

<p><span style="color:grey"><em>Hmm. I disagree.</em></span></p>

<p>Ok, go ahead.</p>

<p><span style="color:grey"><em>He’s saying that he used to be a young rationalist, and he intended to do what was maximally good with his life, because it was logically impossible and therefore literally unimaginable that anything could be better than that. And then he grew up and found himself standing among these chicken wires and rubble and it’s transcendently beautiful, and he’s like ‘man, I really needed to <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/21/universal-love-said-the-cactus-person/">get out of the car</a>’.</em></span></p>

<p>So, he learned that these mundane things were beautiful?</p>

<p><span style="color:grey"><em>No, not beauty traditionally understood. More the kind of transcendent beauty that everything arguably has. He’s found a new kind of thing rather than having clearly learned anything in his previous sense of learning things or found anything nice to look at in his previous sense. What has overall happened and how these things relate to each other, he struggles to put into words, but he also finds that his previous devotion to putting things into words has waned anyway, and not having words no longer feels like unconsciousness..</em></span></p>

<p>Oh, I see—-he was a young rationalist, and then he listened to Hamilton the Musical. Your account doesn’t make sense of the end though: “No one … will believe this … of vast import to the nation.”</p>

<p><span style="color:grey"><em>I can’t even parse it. No one will believe this, which is of vast import to the nation?</em></span></p>

<p>No, I think, ‘no one will believe that this is of vast import to the nation’</p>

<p><span style="color:grey"><em>Ah-then it makes sense: this new thing is of vast import to the nation, but no-one will believe that.</em></span></p>

<p>Seems like a stretch that it is of vast import to the nation.</p>

<p><span style="color:grey"><em>Well if it is vastly important-and it seems to be, because it has transformed his world-then it is probably also vastly important on a national scale. Like, the nation and the transcendent beauty are probably not in separate magisteria.</em></span></p>

<p>Ah. I like your interpretation. It might even be right.</p>

<p><span style="color:grey"><em>It would be nice to be able to contact the author and check. Is he dead?</em></span></p>

<p>I think so. Maybe the internet can tell us something.</p>

<p><span style="color:grey"><em>I don’t know, they might just read into it something about whatever they have going on.</em></span></p>
