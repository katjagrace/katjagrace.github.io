<meta name="description" content="Sometimes I have an urge to photograph things. I usually don’t, because the desire feels ill-motivated—I want to do it to show people, and that seems wrong somehow. It’s not about that usual modern sin: overstating my life for social media credit. It’s more that as I compose a photograph, I am purportedly framing an excerpt from my life, but the life I am showing is not one that I am living. Unless the story I am showing is that on this impeccable French morning, say, I was out there thinking about how to best display said morning to far away social media observers. And photographs of the photographer photographing feel trite, even if it is just metaphorical, so that is never the story that I want to tell. Perhaps the implicit story could be lighter on details: just a woman looking out across the fields one time, who knows why. But still, I wasn’t looking across the fields in the object-level way that it feels like such an image evokes. For instance, I was’t basking in the surreal beauty of the hillsides. I was looking across the fields thinking about how to present them as if someone were looking at them ‘for real’. (How often does anyone look across fields without it being partly about composing an imaginary shot for the imaginary people in their head? Is the dearth of that just me? I can’t even tell how often I do it, but not none.) A different problem with travel photography is that I am nominally taking these photographs ‘for’ someone else, and yet I usually doubt that anyone else gets much out of them. In the stereotypical post-trip scene of the recently-returned traveler proffering a thick photo stack to a friend or relative, I worry that it is the latter doing the former the favor. If I were to post a photograph, would anyone get straightforward pleasure from the scene, and not some meta-level benefit from being able to reinforce our friendship? Or is it just people thinking that other people will like their liking of an image all the way down? I asked my friend about this, and he said that seeing people’s photos is one of the best parts of Facebook, and I realized that I also enjoy that often, and all of my above thoughts are obviously at least somewhat wrong. My stereotypical image might still be common, but it is far from ubiquitous. And this made me realize that it is also outdated: these days one is rarely handed a post-travel photography stack, or sat down for a slide show. Instead, people put photos on social media, which entirely changes the dynamic. Nobody is under almost any pressure to look at anything that they don’t want to, so one can photograph freely in the knowledge that at least one isn’t boring anyone, and if anyone looks, there is a non-negligible chance that they actually like it. With this new understanding in mind, I present not my travel photography, but the pictures I especially wanted to share with at least one particular reader, from a journey into one of my favorite subreddits, Nature is Fucking Lit. These also don’t have the first issue, because whatever motivations I might have for sharing the pictures, they are not the ones with which they were taken." />
