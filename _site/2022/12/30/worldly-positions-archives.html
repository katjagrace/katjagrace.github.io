<p>This seems to have turned out alright for me, since it looks like I just never wrote any drafts that would be too embarrassing to anyone other than myself. And the most embarrassing to myself are probably at the level of bad and abortive poetry. Plus it turned up a few decent drafts to finish, and the adrenaline was a welcome pick-me-up in my current retreat-driven stimulation drought.</p>

<p>Some good bits of the archive (from pre-<a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/worldlypositions.html">WSSP</a> times) according to me:</p>
