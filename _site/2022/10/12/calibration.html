    <p>I’ve been making predictions in a spreadsheet for the last four years, and I recently got to a thousand resolved predictions. Some observations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I’m surprisingly well calibrated for things that mostly aren’t my own behavior<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Here’s the calibration curve for 630 resolved predictions in that class:</p>

    <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/i/katjasgrace/Calibration_for_no-special-context_forecasts_(mostly_excluding_much_own-behavior_prediction)(1).png" alt="calibration no context predictions" width="500" /></p>

    <p><!--ex--></p>

    <p>I don’t know what’s up with the 80% category, but the average miscalibration of the eleven categories is &lt;3%.</p>

    <p>At risk of bragging, this seems wild to me. My experience of making these predictions is fairly well described as ‘pulling a number out of thin air’<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. But apparently if you take all these conjured numbers, and look at the 45 of them that fell in the vicinity of 40%, then I implicitly guessed that 17.28 of those events would happen. And in fact 18 of them happened. WTF? Why wasn’t it eight of them or thirty-five of them? And that was only the fifth most accurate of the eleven buckets shown above! For predictions in the vicinity of 70%, I was off by 0.15%—I said 54.88 of those 80 things would happen, and in fact 55 of them happened.</p>

    <p>Possibly people overall are just better calibrated than I thought. I had some remembered view that people’s asserted 90% confidence intervals were really 50% confidence intervals or something, but I can’t immediately find such evidence now, and I can find various graphs of <a href="https://predictionbook.com/predictions">groups</a> of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Color-online-Calibration-Curves-Conditional-on-When-in-the-Questions-Life-the_fig1_320911494">people</a> <a href="https://goodjudgment.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Superforecasters-A-Decade-of-Stochastic-Dominance.pdf">being</a> on average fairly calibrated. And the <a href="https://predictionbook.com/users/Baeboo">handful</a> <a href="https://predictionbook.com/users/Tapetum-Lucidum">of PredictionBook</a> <a href="https://predictionbook.com/users/gwern">users</a> <a href="https://predictionbook.com/users/JoshuaZ">I could</a> <a href="https://predictionbook.com/users/brunoparga">find</a> with more than a thousand predictions are not hugely worse.</p>

    <p>If you are curious about what I predicted, I put examples at the end of this post.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the entire thousand predictions—the above plus 370 about my own behavior— I’m off by 6.25% on average (up from 2.95%) over the same eleven buckets.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/i/katjasgrace/Calibration_for_all_predictions.png" alt="calibration first 1000 resolved predictions" width="500" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you may infer, I’m pretty bad overall at predicting my own behavior!</p>

    <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/i/katjasgrace/Calibration_for_forecasts_with_context_(mostly_own-behavior)(1).png" alt="calibration first 1000 resolved predictions" width="500" /></p>

    <p>This is more what I expected of a calibration curve—broadly overconfident. And perhaps its general worseness is explained by the appeal of optimism in predicting oneself. But it’s a pretty weird shape, which seems less explicable. If I think there’s a 40% chance that I’ll do something, apparently it’s not happening. If you want it to happen, you should hope I change my mind and put 5% on it!</p>

    <p>I’m not sure what is up with this particular strange shape. But note that making predictions about one’s own behavior has particular complication, if one likes to be right. If you put a number below 50% on taking an action, then you have a disincentive to doing it. So you should then put a lower probability on it than you would have, which would make you even more wrong if you took the action, so you have a further disincentive to doing it, etc. I do generally look for a fixed point where given that I put probability <em>p</em> on something (and the incentive consequences of that), I do think it will happen with probability <em>p</em>. But this is a different process than the usual predicting process, and I could imagine it going wrong in strange ways. For instance, if I’m more motivated by being right than I thought, then 40% predictions which might have been 50% predictions originally should really be 5% predictions. This theory doesn’t really work though, because then shouldn’t the lower categories also be especially overconfident? Whereas in fact they are okay.</p>

    <p>(Maybe I just have free will? The kind of free will that manifests as being about 15% less likely to do anything than one might have expected seems disappointing, but the menu of possible free will options was never that inspiring.)</p>

<p>Categories missing from these randomishly selected lists but notable in being particularly fun:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Predictions of history that I don’t know or remember, followed by looking it up on Wikipedia. A pretty fun combination of predicting things and reading Wikipedia.</li>
  <li>Predictions of relationship persistence in successive episodes of <em>Married at First Sight</em>.</li>

      <p>Except maybe more like art—do you know that feeling where you look at the sketch, and tilt your head from side to side, and say ‘no, a little bit more… just there….mmm…yes…’? It’s like that: ‘27%…no, a little more, 29%? No, 33%. 33%, yes.’ Except honestly it’s more ridiculous than that, because my brain often seems to have views about which particular digits should be involved. So it’s like, ‘23%…no, but mmm 3…33%, yes.’ I am generally in favor of question decomposition and outside views and all that, but to be clear, that’s not what I’m doing here. I might have been sometimes, but these are usually fast intuitive judgments. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
