<p>Vaccination status is at the time of illness. Two people had multiple cases of covid more than two months ago; each case is included separately here (I asked about the date, vaccination status and health consequences for each, so e.g. one person says they got long covid from the second case, so the first is counted under ‘no LC’).</p>

<p>Long covid question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you seem to have ongoing health problems or symptoms after recovering from acute covid illness?</p>

   <td>I am a registered nurse, so I am around a lot of COVID. The lingering symptom that has been the worst is the fatigue. I feel like I am never rested. It actually lead to a car accident because I fell asleep driving after the second round of COVID. I also am not sure if the fatigue is because I never have been given the opportunity to fully rest and recover. I have 2 kids. And with the new "5 day" policy work expects us to come back even symptomatic.
   </td>
   <td>The pandemic has had a huge impact on my life. As a nurse, we learn about pandemics in school but no one ever expects to live through it.  I try to avoid going around high-risk family, I sterilize everything, and I get negative looks if I am in the store in scrubs. I have had to work so many house (especially now because half our staff has COVID), but there has not been any increase in pay. I cannot cook dinner because I am too tired all of the time from the side effects of COVID and from being overworked. I used to love healthcare and now I dont. I think the CDC has lost all credit from anyone in healthcare because their "guidelines" are no longer about the science, it is about the economy. I feel like no one takes it serious and it has defiantly taken a tole on my mental health. Oh, I also had a baby in May of 2020 right when it was getting bad. The fear of the unknown at the time was overwhelming.
