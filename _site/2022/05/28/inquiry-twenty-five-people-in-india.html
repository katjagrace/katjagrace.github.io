<meta name="description" content="Sometimes I get excited about running surveys. Here is a Positly one from November 2020 in which I asked the following questions, to participants from India: What are you looking forward to this week? What do you think of as the most important thing going on in the world right now? If you had a spare half hour right now, what would you do with it? What is something you changed your mind about recently? What in life is more important than other people realize? If someone gave you $5 right now, what would you do with it? Who is someone you think of as a hero? Are you paying attention to the US election? What was the biggest news story this year? I don’t recall any notable constraints other than the location requirement, but I barely remember doing this." />
