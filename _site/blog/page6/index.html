          The art of caring what people think</a><span class="post-meta"> Feb 11, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>People care what people think. People often strive to not care what people think. People sometimes appear to succeed.</p>

<p>My working model though is that it is nearly impossible for a normal person to not care what people think in a prolonged way, but that ‘people’ doesn’t mean all people, and that it is tractable and common to change who falls into this category or who in it is salient and taken to represent ‘people’. And thus it is possible to control the forces of outside perception even as they control you. Which can do a lot of the job of not caring what other people think.</p>

          In balance and flux</a><span class="post-meta"> Feb 11, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>Someone more familiar with ecology recently noted to me that it used to be a popular view that nature was ‘in balance’ and had some equilibrium state, that it should be returned to. Whereas the new understanding is that there was never an equilibrium state. Natural systems are always changing. Another friend who works in natural management also recently told me that their role in the past might have been trying to restore things to their ‘natural state’, but now the goal was to prepare yourself for what your ecology was becoming. A brief Googling returns this National Geographic article by Tik Root, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/balance-of-nature-explained/"><em>The ‘balance of nature’ is an enduring concept. But it’s wrong.</em></a> along the same lines. In fairness, they seem to be arguing against both the idea that nature is in a balance so intense that you can easily disrupt it, and the idea that nature is in a balance so sturdy that it will correct anything you do to it, which sounds plausible. But they don’t say that ecosystems are probably in some kind of intermediately sturdy balance, in many dimensions at least. They say that nature is ‘in flux’ and that the notion of balance is a misconception.</p>

<p>It seems to me though that there is very often equilibrium in some dimensions, even in a system that is in motion in other dimensions, and that that balance can be very important to maintain.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>bicycle</li>
  <li>society with citizens with a variety of demeanors, undergoing broad social change</li>
  <li>human growing older, moving to Germany, and getting pregnant, while maintaining a narrow range of temperatures and blood concentrations of different chemicals</li>
</ul>

          A great hard day</a><span class="post-meta"> Feb 09, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>(Draft from a while ago, lightly edited.)</p>

<p>There were times when I was younger that I used to fantasize about having a friend at all, let alone a boyfriend. And there were times when I thought that if I could just figure out how to make life consistently bearable, I’d really be onto something. So when I say how great my life is, it means that hard lives can get a lot better, not that mine is likely to be consistently more awesome than yours (I hope).</p>

<p>~</p>

<p>Today was great. I arrived in the world caught in a bundle of sheets with my boyfriend. Half asleep, I decided to wake him up by incrementally escalated cuddling, which I assume is similar in its benefits to those slowly loudening alarms.</p>

          Evolution from distinction difference</a><span class="post-meta"> Feb 08, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>If we have norms such that each copy of a common behavior <a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2021/02/07/the-distinction-difference.html">must to be a tiny step away from from its parent</a>, rather than a giant step or no step, this would seem to make culture much more amenable to gradient descent via evolution than it otherwise would be.</p>

<p>Is the latter somehow reason for us seeing the former? For instance, did ancient groups who frowned on really weird people and who felt awkward being too conformist outflourish other groups with their better evolved cultural norms and artifacts?</p>

          The distinction distance</a><span class="post-meta"> Feb 07, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>People have a strong tendency to be different from one another (e.g. are horrified to be caught in the same dress, find it weird to order the same dishes as their companion without comment or to choose the same art for their living room). Yet they also have a strong tendency to conform.</p>

<p>These are even in the same areas, and the best behavior seems to be balancing on an edge between the two forces. You don’t want to wear either a dress that someone else is wearing, nor a dress in a style that hasn’t been worn since the 1600s.</p>

          Massive consequences</a><span class="post-meta"> Feb 06, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>Hypothesis: whenever you make a choice, the consequences of it are almost as likely to be bad as good, because the scale of the intended consequences is radically smaller than the scale of the chaotic unintended effects. (The expected outcome is still as positive as you think, it’s just a small positive value plus a very high variance random value at each step.)</p>

<p>This seems different from how things are usually conceived, but does it change anything that we don’t already know about?</p>

<p>Could this be false?</p>

          Current cryonics impressions</a><span class="post-meta"> Feb 06, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>People around me often sign up for cryonics, and say that it is very important. My guess is that this argument for it, heavily inspired by <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/cryonics.html">Waitbutwhy</a>’s much longer piece, as well as years of talking to people around me and reading <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/">their</a> <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/">blogs</a>, is correct:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>One day people will probably live much longer than they do now.<br /><br />Probably we will work out how to beat the diseases of aging, as we have many of the infectious diseases. Eventually dying at age 90 of heart disease will seem as much of a needless tragedy as dying of an infection at age 45 does to us now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One day we will probably be able to ‘freeze’ and usefully thaw organs like brains using vitrification.<br /><br />We can already do this with other organs. For instance <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2781097/">a rabbit kidney can apparently already be vitrified then warmed up and put back in a rabbit and work</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People can start to successfully evade the diseases of aging as soon as science reaches the freezing part of 2, even if it hasn’t got to the thawing part or to 1 yet. Because once you are vitrified, you can wait quite a long time for further developments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a decent chance that we are already at the freezing part of 2. For instance, <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/332074-cryonics-rabbit-brain-regenerated/">a defrosted vitrified rabbit brain apparently appeared to be in good order</a>, though I assume we don’t know how to reattach brains to rabbits, alas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The chance that we are there on the freezing is high enough that people dying soon (by our current standards of irrevivability) should generally be vitrified instead of burned or buried, if the chance to survive longer is worth the price to them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can sign up for something like this at the cost of a not-super-expensive life insurance policy, though I think the more promising techniques at the moment aren’t available yet to purchase.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><br />
I haven’t actually signed up for this, but I might, and if I thought there was a higher chance of me dying sooner, I would get around to figuring it out more urgently. So I thought I’d point it out to others older than me, who might want to think about it more promptly.</p>

<p>I found <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/cryonics.html">Waitbutwhy</a>’s essay on these topics pretty good.</p>

          Ways of being with you</a><span class="post-meta"> Feb 04, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>Suppose you want to get in touch with your care for someone, or to feel empathy for them. One way is to imagine what it is like to be them, looking out of their eyes and feeling what they are feeling. For instance, if your friend did something frustrating, you might imagine the experience of choosing under pressure that might have led to it, and you might thereby feel warmth toward them and sympathy for their error.</p>

<p>But I think it is more common to do something else, kind of like imagining them from the outside, but such that their mental content is also somehow accessible.</p>

          Speaking of the efficiency of utopia</a><span class="post-meta"> Feb 03, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>I <a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2021/01/28/unpopularity-of-efficiency.html">noted</a> that it is probably reasonable for people to be wary of things introducing themselves as ‘efficiency’, since maximization of specific metrics has some tendency to go badly.</p>

<p>On the other hand, ‘efficiency’ doesn’t mean anything about building explicit or quantitative machinery. It just means getting a lot of the desired output per input. So one might wonder why, if these explicit efforts would tend to make things worse for our actual goals, we would pursue efficiency in such ways, and continue to call that ‘efficiency’. For those who think quantitative pursuit of well-defined goals has been a bad strategy overall, shouldn’t ‘efficient daycare’ suggest a daycare where we have used our best intuitions for holistically improving the experience?</p>

          Covid cafes</a><span class="post-meta"> Feb 02, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>I’m puzzled that during the pandemic so few cafes near me have moved to serving customers outside, by moving their ordering and payment apparatus to the doorway. I’ve seen about five cafes in San Francisco do this (few enough that none are conveniently close).</p>

<p>(I wanted to include a photo, but I actually just can’t find a picture online, such an obscure idea it is, I guess?)</p>

<p>Is this harder than it looks to organize? And even if it is for a small business run by a single person without a spare second all year to think about aerosols or reorganize, I’m still surprised that Starbucks doesn’t have its act together more.</p>
