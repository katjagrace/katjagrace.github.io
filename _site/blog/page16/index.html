          Why Trump? A survey</a><span class="post-meta"> Nov 06, 2020</span>
      </h3><p>It felt strange going into this US election so hopeful for Biden to win while so at a loss regarding why comparably many Americans were badly hoping for the opposite. I heard people <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/224-key-trumps-appeal/">speculating</a> about the possible motives, and I considered plausible steelmen. But why should I be guessing about what half of people think? I <a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/11/05/election-survey.html">figured out</a> how to survey some Americans beyond my vicinity.</p>

          Everyone headed to win</a><span class="post-meta"> Nov 05, 2020</span>
      </h3><p>Last night I was especially curious about why people vote as they do, and whether they were experiencing the election similarly to me. So I set up a survey in <a href="https://www.positly.com/">Positly</a> and paid a bunch of people to tell me about such things.</p>

<p>I haven’t read all of the responses yet, but a notable feature of them so far is the extent to which people expected their own favorite candidate to win the presidency.  If someone said both who they voted for (or would vote for if forced to vote) and who they thought would win, these were the same person 87% of the time.</p>

<p>Is this just ‘wishful thinking’ (whatever that is) or some more interesting phenomenon?</p>

          Election night</a><span class="post-meta"> Nov 03, 2020</span>
      </h3><p>Earlier in the evening, I reasoned that I should not ‘watch’ the election, since I will learn the result in the end and experiencing the uncertainty in the meantime doesn’t seem productive at all, let alone competitive with other things I could do.</p>

<p>This attitude somehow felt unfriendly though, or like being the kind of spoilsport who says ‘there is no reason to celebrate Christmas, or to celebrate anything for that matter’—both failing to add to the fun, and implicitly asking others to defend their own enthusiasm.</p>

      </h3><p>It is said that we share <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-does-the-fact-that-w/">99.9%</a> of our genes with one another, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-does-the-fact-that-w/">95%</a> with chimpanzees, and <a href="https://www.breakthroughs.com/foundations-science/how-genetically-related-are-we-bananas">60%</a> with bananas. (It is also <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/genetic/people-bananas-share-dna.htm">said</a> that this isn’t quite right about bananas, but reading about that did not quell my confusion.)</p>

<p>It is further said that I share 50% of my genes with my brother, and that this is why I like him.</p>

<p>And yet, I seem to be more closely related to my brother than to a banana.</p>

          Questions of the afternoon</a><span class="post-meta"> Nov 01, 2020</span>
      </h3><p>Today I spent about three hours chatting with eleven of my closer friends who I’ve mostly hardly seen this year, as a virtual birthday party. I thought the discussion was pretty interesting—so I record here some of the questions that came up (aloud or my mind):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Did various of us err by not doing technical subjects in undergrad? Or should we have tried to do ‘cool’ seeming subjects, technical or not?</li>
  <li>What is ‘coolness’? Is coolness always about power? Why is a big, fast train cool? Can you be cool if you are not relaxed? If you are small and scared? If you are mediocre in every way?</li>
  <li>Is etymology deep? What do people get out of knowing the origins of words?</li>
  <li>What is going on in history, at a high level?</li>
  <li>Can history be understood at a high level, or to have a real understanding of ‘what’s going on’, do you need to know about the detailed circumstances in each case?</li>
</ol>

          Automated intelligence is not AI</a><span class="post-meta"> Nov 01, 2020</span>
      </h3><p>Sometimes we think of ‘artificial intelligence’ as whatever technology ultimately automates human cognitive labor.</p>

<p>I question this equivalence, looking at past automation. In practice human cognitive labor is replaced by things that don’t seem at all cognitive, or like what we otherwise mean by AI.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

          Study of a 34th birthday</a><span class="post-meta"> Oct 31, 2020</span>
      </h3><p>It was recently my birthday. I started the celebrations by sleeping in so late that I probably wouldn’t be that sleep deprived. My boyfriend continued the celebrations by making me breakfast in bed and setting aside his work, donning a hat, and singing to me when I woke. He actually always makes me breakfast and it is usually in bed, but that didn’t really detract from it.</p>

          Why don&#39;t presidential candidates seem more ideal?</a><span class="post-meta"> Oct 30, 2020</span>
      </h3><p>Without speaking to my own judgments of historical candidates, my impression is that people very often vote (in US primaries and elections at least) with an attitude of ‘ugh well it can’t be Alice, so I guess it has to be Bob, even though he is evil as far as I can tell’ rather than, ‘wow, Alice is one of the most shining examples of an excellent leader and all around good person I have ever witnessed, but I just have to vote for Bob because he is astonishingly even better, and when I see him speak it just makes me cry because I can’t donate money to his campaign fast enough’.</p>

<p>There are like <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-people-are-eligible-to-become-president">150 million</a> eligible US citizens to choose from for president, and in my experience many people generally inspire excitement and warmth in others, and are reasonable and knowledgeable and good.</p>
