          Oliver Sipple</a><span class="post-meta"> Feb 18, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>The other day I read Wikipedia arguably too much, and consequently came to know the story of Oliver Sipple. Here’s my summary of the story according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Sipple">these</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Gerald_Ford_in_San_Francisco">two</a> Wikipedia pages and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070831033508/http://www.lambda.net/~maximum/sipple.html">this</a> page:</p>

<p>In the September of 1975, Oliver (‘Billy’) Sipple was an ex-marine of thirty-three, injured in Vietnam and living in San Francisco. He was in and out of the veteran’s hospital, six years into civilian life.</p>

<p>One afternoon, he stood in a crowd of thousands of people to see the visiting President Gerald Ford leave a San Francisco hotel from across the street. Ford stopped to wave. Suddenly, a shot sounded, and Oliver saw a woman nearby adjusting the aim of her revolver. He lunged and grabbed her arm, sending the second bullet into the hotel, injuring a man inside.</p>

<p>Oliver was thanked for saving the president, and celebrated as a hero by the media. A heroic veteran.</p>

<p>Soon the media learned that he was in fact a heroic <em>gay</em> veteran.</p>

      </h3><p>My <a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/12/01/points-for-anxiety.html">points for anxiety</a> system continued to help, but was encumbered by the friction of getting my phone out to mark points. Thus I have turned to wearable abaci.</p>

<p>I made this necklace according to very roughly <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/212724782374260653/">this picture</a>, using knitting wool and beads I bought at one point to use as virtual in-house currency and now found in a box in my room. It works well! The beads don’t shift unless I move them, which is easy and pleasing. It seems clearly more convenient than my phone. (Plus, I can show off to those in the know that I have 4 or 6 or 24 or 26 of something!) I am also for now reminded when I look in a mirror to consider whether I can get a point, which is currently a plus.</p>

      </h3><p><em>(This is my attempt to summarize the ‘Taste &amp; Shaping’ module in a <a href="https://www.rationality.org/">CFAR</a> 2018 participant handbook I have, in order to understand it better (later version available online <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UZYBtOJ3QZ7FTI_4eKjVzBSNUqC_Uba3/view">here</a>). It may be basically a mixture of their content and my misunderstandings. Sorry for any misunderstandings propagated. I also haven’t checked or substantially experimented with most of this, but it seems so far like a good addition to my mental library of concepts.)</em></p>

<p>Some things seem nice, and you just automatically do them (or gravitate toward them), and have to put in effort if you don’t want that to happen. Other things seem icky, and even though maybe you know they are good, you won’t get around to them for months even if they would take a minute and you spend more than that long every week glancing at them and deciding to do them later. (In my own dialect, the former are ‘delicious’. As in, ‘oh goody, my delicious book’).</p>

<p>How delicious things seem is caused by a kind of estimate by your brain of how good that thing will be for the goals it thinks you have.</p>

<p>Your brain makes these estimates in a funny way, with some non-obvious features:</p>

Things just can’t be infinitely more important than other things, in a world where possible trades weave everything together.

It’s not very long.</p>

<p>Here is an excerpt inspired by events leading to my first kiss (names changed, coincidence with name of my later partner coincidental):</p>

<p><em>The main argument for believing other people are conscious is that in all other respects they resemble you. Carrie stared tiredly into the crowd of blurs surrounding her and found this argument uncompelling. She couldn’t actually imagine thinking any of the things that had recently been shouted near her, which strengthened the hypothesis that nobody else was thinking them either. Which pressed the question of why someone was simulating this particular reality for her, and what the significance was of a tall man screeching ‘It’s beer pong o clock!’.</em></p>

          The ecology of conviction</a><span class="post-meta"> Feb 13, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>Supposing that <a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/11/30/sincerity-trends.html">sincerity has declined</a>, why?</p>

<p>It feels natural to me that sincere enthusiasms should be rare relative to criticism and half-heartedness. But I would have thought this was born of fairly basic features of the situation, and so wouldn’t change over time.</p>

<p>It seems clearly easier and less socially risky to be critical of things, or non-committal, than to stand for a positive vision. It is easier to produce a valid criticism than an idea immune to valid criticism (and easier again to say, ‘this is very simplistic - the situation is subtle’). And if an idea is criticized, the critic gets to seem sophisticated, while the holder of the idea gets to seem naïve. A criticism is smaller than a positive vision, so a critic is usually not staking their reputation on their criticism as much, or claiming that it is good, in the way that the enthusiast is.</p>

          The art of caring what people think</a><span class="post-meta"> Feb 11, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>People care what people think. People often strive to not care what people think. People sometimes appear to succeed.</p>

<p>My working model though is that it is nearly impossible for a normal person to not care what people think in a prolonged way, but that ‘people’ doesn’t mean all people, and that it is tractable and common to change who falls into this category or who in it is salient and taken to represent ‘people’. And thus it is possible to control the forces of outside perception even as they control you. Which can do a lot of the job of not caring what other people think.</p>

          In balance and flux</a><span class="post-meta"> Feb 11, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>Someone more familiar with ecology recently noted to me that it used to be a popular view that nature was ‘in balance’ and had some equilibrium state, that it should be returned to. Whereas the new understanding is that there was never an equilibrium state. Natural systems are always changing. Another friend who works in natural management also recently told me that their role in the past might have been trying to restore things to their ‘natural state’, but now the goal was to prepare yourself for what your ecology was becoming. A brief Googling returns this National Geographic article by Tik Root, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/balance-of-nature-explained/"><em>The ‘balance of nature’ is an enduring concept. But it’s wrong.</em></a> along the same lines. In fairness, they seem to be arguing against both the idea that nature is in a balance so intense that you can easily disrupt it, and the idea that nature is in a balance so sturdy that it will correct anything you do to it, which sounds plausible. But they don’t say that ecosystems are probably in some kind of intermediately sturdy balance, in many dimensions at least. They say that nature is ‘in flux’ and that the notion of balance is a misconception.</p>

<p>It seems to me though that there is very often equilibrium in some dimensions, even in a system that is in motion in other dimensions, and that that balance can be very important to maintain.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>bicycle</li>
  <li>society with citizens with a variety of demeanors, undergoing broad social change</li>
  <li>human growing older, moving to Germany, and getting pregnant, while maintaining a narrow range of temperatures and blood concentrations of different chemicals</li>

          A great hard day</a><span class="post-meta"> Feb 09, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>(Draft from a while ago, lightly edited.)</p>

<p>There were times when I was younger that I used to fantasize about having a friend at all, let alone a boyfriend. And there were times when I thought that if I could just figure out how to make life consistently bearable, I’d really be onto something. So when I say how great my life is, it means that hard lives can get a lot better, not that mine is likely to be consistently more awesome than yours (I hope).</p>

<p>~</p>

<p>Today was great. I arrived in the world caught in a bundle of sheets with my boyfriend. Half asleep, I decided to wake him up by incrementally escalated cuddling, which I assume is similar in its benefits to those slowly loudening alarms.</p>
