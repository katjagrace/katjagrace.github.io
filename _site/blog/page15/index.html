          Schedules versus momentum</a><span class="post-meta"> Nov 15, 2020</span>
      </h3><p>A mundane issue that arises endlessly in my life, but which I haven’t heard that much advice on: what to do when your schedule says you should do one thing, but you have momentum on a different thing? Or more broadly, what to do when scheduling and energy for a task conflict?</p>

          The day of Hellfire</a><span class="post-meta"> Nov 15, 2020</span>
      </h3><p>With the 2020 reduction of variety in places and companionship that might set the days apart, there is a risk of swathes of time blending together and seeming short. One solution is to substitute other sources of visceral variety. Yesterday I had the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3NoDEu7kpg">Hellfire</a> from Disney’s The Hunchback of Notre Dame stuck in my head all day, which I can recommend as intense and a different vibe from normal.</p>

          Overlooking the obvious</a><span class="post-meta"> Nov 13, 2020</span>
      </h3><p>One can feel stupid for not having tried the obvious thing. For instance, if you have terrible anxiety, and you tell your friend, and your friend is like, ‘um, have you considered anxiety drugs?’, and somehow it hasn’t occurred to you, you can feel stupid.</p>

<p>I think this is often wrong, because there are so many obvious things.</p>

          Misalignment and misuse: whose values are manifest?</a><span class="post-meta"> Nov 13, 2020</span>
      </h3><p>AI related disasters are often categorized as involving misaligned AI, or misuse, or accident. Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>misuse means the bad outcomes were wanted by the people involved,</li>
  <li>misalignment means the bad outcomes were wanted by AI (and not by its human creators), and</li>
  <li>accident means that the bad outcomes were not wanted by those in power but happened anyway due to error.</li>
</ul>

<p>In thinking about specific scenarios, these concepts seem less helpful.</p>

          Migraine basket</a><span class="post-meta"> Nov 12, 2020</span>
      </h3><p>I get migraines about once a week. They aren’t as bad as migraines are classically understood to be—in fact they always start out pretty mild—but they sometimes become terrible by the evening.</p>

<p>While there are always various things I could do to improve such situations, I have often failed to do them promptly. Which seems pretty weird, but I suppose I am not at my most energetic and mentally functional. Also, none of the interventions I know of actually resolve migraines instantaneously, so my sense that I should for instance take painkillers is more of an intellectual one than a felt urge. And I think suffering drains my interest in upholding vague intellectual senses that I should do things. Then even if I did remember, it’s a further effort to even recall what else might be good, let alone go and find the relevant objects.</p>

<p>I have improved this a fair bit with a retrospectively obvious innovation: the migraine basket.</p>

          And you&#39;ll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon</a><span class="post-meta"> Nov 11, 2020</span>
      </h3><p>Over toothbrushing tonight, my boyfriend and I analyzed the song ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9MvdMqKvpU">Colors of the Wind</a>’, from Pocahontas, which we had just listened to in curiosity over Roger Ebert’s <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-hunchback-of-notre-dame-1996">claim</a> that The Hunchback of Notre Dame has a better message than Pocahontas.</p>

<p>A pair of lines that caught my attention were:</p>

<p><em>‘Come roll in all the riches all around you</em>
<em>And for once, never wonder what they’re worth’</em></p>

<p>This suggests that wondering what everything is worth negates what is valuable about it, which is to say, makes it worth less to you. Is it true that looking out for value like this is self-undermining? It sounds plausible to me, but why?</p>

      </h3><p>Should social media label statements as false, misleading or contested?</p>

<p>Let’s approach it from the perspective of what would make the world best, rather than e.g. what rights do the social media companies have, as owners of the social media companies.</p>

<p>The basic upside seems to be that pragmatically, people share all kinds of false things on social media, and that leads to badness, and this slows that down.</p>

          On the fifth day of election</a><span class="post-meta"> Nov 08, 2020</span>
      </h3><p>I was woken yesterday by cheering and whooping in the streets.</p>

<p>(Which was overall great, though I think replacing the part of the day, [get enough sleep and then wake up and remember who you are and what you were doing and then do some familiar morning rituals while your brain warms up] with [abrupt emergence into city-wide celebration] was disorienting in a way that I failed to shake all day.)</p>

<p>After some music, Champagne, party hats, chatting with the housemates, and putting on our best red-white-and-blue outfits, my boyfriend and I set out for a walk in the city, tentatively toward b. patisserie, legendary and inconveniently distant producer of kouignoù amann.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Within a few blocks we found cars and pedestrians breaking into rounds of cheering and waving at each other, and a general sense that the whole street was a party to this. We still had our party hats, one with an American flag sticking out of the top, so there was no ambiguity for other street-goers about whether we were.</p>

<p>In my experience and current judgment:</p>

<p>The best non-inert art is the musical Hamilton</p>

<p>The best place in the San Francisco Bay Area is the <a href="https://worldlypositions.tumblr.com/post/172912945074/experimental-ethics-hot-tub-adventure">Essex Hot Tub</a>, and the best place near it is Bodega Bay</p>

<p>The best undergraduate degree to wish you had done is computer science</p>
