          A game for seeing each step matter</a><span class="post-meta"> Jan 10, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>When I have an overwhelming number of things to do, and insufficient felt urge to do them, I often arrange them into a kind of game for myself. The nature and appeal of this game has been relatively stable for about a year, after a long evolution, so this seems like a reasonable time to share it. I also play it when I just want to structure my day and am in the mood for it, currently something like two or three times a week.</p>

<p>The basic idea is to lay out the tasks in time a bit like obstacles in a platformer or steps in Dance Dance Revolution, then race through the obstacle course grabbing them, under consistently high-but-doable time pressure.</p>

<p>Here’s how to play:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Draw a grid with as many rows as there are remaining hours in your hoped for productive day, and ~3 columns. Each box stands for a particular ~20 minute period (I sometimes play with 15m or 30m periods.)</li>
  <li>Lay out the gameboard: break the stuff you want to do into appropriate units, henceforth ‘items’. An item should fit comfortably in the length of a block, and it should be easy enough to verify completion. (This can be achieved through house rules such as ‘do x a tiny bit = do it until I have a sense that an appropriate tiny bit has been done’ as long as you are happy applying them). Space items out a decent amount so that the whole course is clearly feasible. Include nice or relaxing things, or break activities. Drinks, snacks, tiny bouts of exercise, looking at news sites for 5 minutes, etc. Design the track thoughtfully, with hard bouts followed by relief before the next hard bout.</li>
  <li>The goal in playing is to collect as many items as you can, as you are forced along the track by the passage of time. You can collect an item by doing the task in or before its box. If it isn’t done by the end of the box, it gets left behind. However if you clear any box entirely, you get to move one item anywhere on the gameboard. So you can rescue something from the past, or rearrange the future to make it more feasible, or if everything is perfect, you can add an entirely new item.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think a basic problem with working on a big pile of things in a big expanse of time is that if you work or not during any particular minute, it feels like it makes nearly no difference to the expectation of success. I’m not quite sure why this is—in fact if I don’t work this minute, I’m going to get one minute less work done. But it feels like if I don’t work this minute, I only need to work a smidgen faster on average to get any particular amount of work done, so what does it matter if i work now or later? And if i had some particular goal, it’s unlikely that my other efforts will get me exactly to the line where this minute pushed me over—probably I will either succeed with hours to spare (haha) or fail hours from my goals. Yet on the other hand, the pleasure of not working this specific minute is distinctly, tangibly higher than the pleasure of working. So my felt sense of value often favors not working, even if a more rational accounting would disagree.</p>

<p>Having a single specific thing to do within minutes is much more compelling. The task and the time are lined up so that my action right now matters. Slacking this minute is the difference between a concrete success or failure. It feels very different to have one email to deal with in the next three minutes and to have a thousand emails to deal with in the next fifty hours.
<!-- In the latter case, while in some sense the time pressure is the same, I probably start by getting myself a drink and pottering around staring out of the window or something. --></p>

<p>One might naively respond to this issue by breaking up one’s tasks into tiny chunks, then laying them out in a day of tiny time boxes, then aiming for each to happen by the end of its allotment. But this will be terrible. A few boxes in, either you’ll be ahead or behind. And either way, your immediate actions have drifted away from feeling like they matter. If you are ahead, the pressure is off: you’ll probably succeed at the next increment whether or not you work hard now. If behind, you are definitely going to fail at doing the next box on time, and probably some others, and your present work is for an increased chance of catching up at some future box, much like before you had these boxes.
<!-- and can substitute with all of the other intervening time. So again, working less hard this minute means you have to work a tiny bit harder in the next five boxes say, to catch up then. So what you do in this minute doesn't viscerally change the odds much. --></p>

<p>The idea this game is to instead meet tasks one at a time where each one matters in its moment, like in Beat Saber. The game achieves this by adjusting the slack to keep the next ten minutes’ action near the actually-mattering-to-success line all day. If you get behind you have to give up on items and move forward, so you aren’t left struggling for a low probability of catching up. If you get ahead, you add more items and thus tighten the slack.</p>

        <a class="post-link" href="/2021/01/09/a-different-dictionary.html">
          A different dictionary</a><span class="post-meta"> Jan 09, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>I enjoyed James Somers <a href="https://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary">account</a> (HT <a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/12/19/thesauring.html#comment-5194868155">Liron Shapira</a>) of how Webster’s dictionary used to be much more beautiful than dictionaries today, for instance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“…Flashing differs from exploding or disploding in not being accompanied with a loud report. To glisten, or glister, is to shine with a soft and fitful luster, as eyes suffused with tears, or flowers wet with dew.”</em>
<br />
<br />
Did you see that last clause? “To shine with a soft and fitful luster, as eyes suffused with tears, or flowers wet with dew.” I’m not sure why you won’t find writing like that in dictionaries these days, but you won’t. Here is the modern equivalent of that sentence in the latest edition of the Merriam-Webster: “glisten applies to the soft sparkle from a wet or oily surface <glistening wet="" sidewalk="">.”
<br />
<br />
Who decided that the American public couldn’t handle “a soft and fitful luster”? I can’t help but think something has been lost. “A soft sparkle from a wet or oily surface” doesn’t just sound worse, it actually describes the phenomenon with less precision. In particular it misses the shimmeriness, the micro movement and action, “the fitful luster,” of, for example, an eye full of tears — which is by the way far more intense and interesting an image than “a wet sidewalk.”</glistening></p>

      </h3><p>In chess, you can’t play by picking a desired end of the game and backward chaining to the first move, because there are vastly more possible chains of moves than your brain can deal with, and the good ones are few. Instead, chess players steer by heuristic senses of the worth of situations. I assume they still back-chain a few moves (‘if I go there, she’ll have to move her rook, freeing my queen’) but just leading from a heuristically worse to a heuristically better situation a short hop away.</p>

          Evening drawing</a><span class="post-meta"> Jan 07, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>This evening I became tempted by a YouTube video of an artist painting a portrait, which led me to be tempted by another such video, and then more of them, and then by one of these artists’ websites, and then by my own pencils and paper. (I did not become tempted by YouTube videos advertising breaking news of some sort of crazy Trump riot, since I decided not to ‘check the internet’ until bed time).</p>

          Intended enjoyment</a><span class="post-meta"> Jan 05, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>I am sometimes unsure what is meant to be enjoyed in things, for instance the short story <a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2021/01/04/giaconda-smile.html"><em>The Gioconda Smile</em></a>, or <em>In the mood for love</em> which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/13/100-best-films-movies-of-the-21st-century">people</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_considered_the_best">often</a> enjoy a lot. Which seems like it shouldn’t be a problem, as long as I find something to enjoy in them. But it also seems like I would be seriously missing something if I was buying bags of coffee all these years just to appreciate the thick, substantive quality of the paper bag between my teeth as I chewed it. How many of my enjoyments are like this?</p>

      </h3><p><em>(Spoiler alert: discusses entire plot of The Gioconda Smile by Aldous Huxley)</em></p>

<p>I’ve been reading short stories lately, which are often confusing to me, and I frequently wish that the author resolved the actual tension and relieved my actual curiosity more, by including some sort of short note at the end on what they were even trying to do.</p>

<p>With that said, I read Aldous Huxley’s <em>The Gioconda Smile</em>, and was somewhat confused by it. I mean, it was a story. But since I got it from ‘50 Great Short Stories…a comprehensive selection from the world’s finest short fiction’, I’m expecting it to be somehow surpassingly great.</p>

      </h3><p>I thought it would be interesting to try to write my <a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2021/01/01/review-the-diving-bell-and-the-butterfly.html">review</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diving_Bell_and_the_Butterfly"><em>the Diving Bell and the Butterfly</em></a> in my head without setting pen to paper until the end, and to convey at least some of it by blinking, since I find the fact that the author wrote the whole book in this way astonishing. Perhaps experiencing that process myself would improve my understanding of things, such that I wouldn’t be astonished.</p>

<p>I think trying to do this was an even better exercise than I expected, though by the end I was frustrated to the point of tears, and I’m still feeling kind of annoyed, having just put it up.</p>

          Review: The Diving Bell and the Butterfly</a><span class="post-meta"> Jan 01, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>I suspect my mind of taking its observations of a person’s physical energy and dexterity as strong evidence about their mental quickness and clarity.</p>

<p>The existence and the wrongness of this presumption were brought into relief for me by reading Jean-Dominique Bauby’s <em>The Diving Bell and the Butterfly</em>, on his life with locked-in syndrome. Because realizing that the author’s lively and intelligent voice was issued from a single blinking eye looking out of a mostly inert body felt like seeing a magic trick.</p>
