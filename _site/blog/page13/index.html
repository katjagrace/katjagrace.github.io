<p>A photograph taken during a discussion of how photographs often fail to capture scenes.</p>

<p>It seems to me that photos often don’t capture what the photographer saw in the scene (perhaps especially if the photographer isn’t really a photographer). But it’s kind of amazing that I think of this as ‘the photograph failed to capture what it was really like’, rather than ‘my perception failed to capture what it was really like, as evidenced by this photograph’!</p>

          Cultural accumulation</a><span class="post-meta"> Dec 05, 2020</span>
      </h3><p>When I think of humans being so smart due to ‘cultural accumulation’, I think of lots of tiny innovations in thought and technology being made by different people, and added to the interpersonal currents of culture that wash into each person’s brain, leaving a twenty year old in 2020 much better intellectually equipped than a 90 year old who spent their whole life thinking in 1200 AD.</p>

      </h3><p>I attended a friend’s wedding this year, that was in the form of a play which everyone was sent in book form, to read at the same time from different places. There were various interactive interludes, including phone calls with strangers I had been algorithmically matched with, and a big group Zoom. I liked it.</p>

<p>When I was a child, I had a ‘Christmas book’ that I liked, with lots of different nice things in it, like stories about the nativity, and about the Christmas ceasefire in World War I, and songs, and instructions for making foods and decorations, and descriptions of Christmas in other places.</p>

<p><strong>The Milkmaid, by Johannes Vermeer.</strong></p>

<p>I have had a soft spot for Vermeer, the 17th Century Dutch artist, ever since I was compelled to write about him in high school, and I especially like this painting. I think it’s a particularly good example of how his painting of textures makes them seem almost supernaturally pleasing. I wouldn’t usually think of myself as a huge fan of textures. But here—the seed encrusted bread looks so crisp and solid, I can imagine the sound of my hand knocking some seeds off as I pick it up, or the thud of the loaf if I tapped it.</p>

          Inbox zero day</a><span class="post-meta"> Dec 01, 2020</span>
      </h3><p>Today I spent the entire day emptying my main work email inbox of all its emails, many of which had lived there for years. Apparently it was last empty around when I got that email in early 2014. I had committed to someone that I would archive anything left in that account without reading it at 10:30 tonight, and thereby give up on getting to it. And I wanted to at least glance at things. The point of all this was to not have the ever-present sense of a giant backlog of things I am supposed to deal with, of which mounds of non-given-up-on emails are one piece. (Another option would be to just give up on everything that was ever pending, but I’m not quite up for it.)</p>

          Points for anxiety</a><span class="post-meta"> Dec 01, 2020</span>
      </h3><p>I have an intermittently crippling anxiety disorder, so I recently started trying a new kind of therapy to mitigate it. I’ve been finding sufficiently great so far that even if it doesn’t work long term I will probably think it was worth it. So I’ll tell you about it.</p>

<p>It is based on <a href="https://noiseinyourhead.com/">Reid Wilson’s</a> ideas, I think as described in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stopping-Noise-Your-Head-Overcome/dp/0757319068">his book</a>, though I haven’t read it and most of my understanding comes from my therapist, my friend who also does this, and a <a href="https://noiseinyourhead.com/free-video-series/">set of humorous videos on Reid Wilson’s website</a>.</p>

<p>Here is the practice, as I practice it:</p>

          Sincerity trends</a><span class="post-meta"> Nov 29, 2020</span>
      </h3><p>I have the impression that sincerity, earnestness and straightforward conviction used to be more popular flavors of attitude and have been replaced (at least in the public sphere) by more self-conscious, ironic, critical, half-hearted, cool type attitudes. I went hiking with a friend today, and he mentioned the same impression (though I may have got mine from him), and we speculated about the reasons.</p>

<p>Does everyone share this impression? Over what time-scales? Do we have good explanations?</p>

          Another point of view on the details</a><span class="post-meta"> Nov 28, 2020</span>
      </h3><p>This morning my boyfriend and I did an activity where he followed me around for a couple of hours and observed as I started the day and did some tasks. (I’ve also done something like that before with a friend who was trying out anthropology.) I suggested it this time because I often find it enlightening to hear an outside perspective on things that I do, and his in particular. And it seems rarer to hear about the details and tactics, versus very high level questions: I often know what projects another person thinks are good, but rarely know what they would do if they got an email asking to hang out from an acquaintance, or if they were feeling antsy, or how they would decide where to start on the project in question, or when to stop.</p>

          The Hunchback of Notre Dame as a 1996 taste datapoint</a><span class="post-meta"> Nov 27, 2020</span>
      </h3><p>My household watched the 1996 Disney version of <em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em> recently. A notable thing about it to me was that the humor seemed in such poor taste. Which made me wonder, was 1996 just culturally different? Slapstick humor includes an emaciated old man imprisoned in a cylindrical cage tumbling over and over while someone runs on top of it, before he escapes, only to accidentally fall into some stocks. Ha! During a song, romantic rivals are jovially represented as hanging in the gallows. Various jokes are made around two men being sentenced to hanging without trial or ability to speak (‘any last words? didn’t think so’). Maybe I’m wrong that this would all seem weird to current viewers, and instead I’m just out of touch.</p>
