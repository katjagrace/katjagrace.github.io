          Meditative thinking</a><span class="post-meta"> Jan 15, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>I got fairly into meditation in 2018. Not in a way where you do a huge amount of meditation, or seek guidance on how to do meditation well, or on whether what you are doing is meditation at all. I don’t think I even graduated from doing meditation largely in five minute bouts. I just really dug a set of mental things which seemed related to meditation. I was riding an ethos. I suppose meditation was a particularly namable point in the space, but not obviously the most exciting part of it, so I ended up being pretty excited about ‘meditation…?’ while not actually meditating that much.</p>

<p>I also remained so ignorant about meditation traditions and previous human meditation experience that you might doubt that I’m talking about the same thing. (I did talk to other people a little, and did about five guided meditations, which seemed like a different kind of thing anyway, but also very awesome.)</p>

<p>With that said, here’s a kind of meditation I made up. I call it, ‘meditative thinking’. In it, you do all the stuff you would usually do while meditating: be in a meditation-conducive position (I do lying on my back, which I hear is a bad idea, but it is very comfy); set a meditation timer with bells at the start and end (mine also makes water sounds between them, but this probably isn’t crucial); close your eyes; be aware of your breathing; then just go on being aware of stuff in a conspicuously conscious way. But before all this, choose a question to think about. And then, once meditating, think about the question. Maintain the same mental stance as you normally would meditating, insofar as that makes sense. Be aware of your breathing, and your awareness, and your thinking. If you stop thinking about the question, gently bring your awareness back to it.</p>

<p>I still find this good. Though it’s possible that it gets much of its benefit from being a ritualistic way to actually think about a question for five or ten minutes without reflexively opening Facebook because thinking doesn’t correspond to a tab or occupy one’s hands.</p>

<p>“But I don’t have two—I’m talking about the actual concept”</p>

<p>“There isn’t an actual concept, there are a bajillion concepts, and you can use whichever one you want.”</p>

<p>“There’s one that people mean”</p>

<p>“Not really—each person has a slightly different usage, and probably hasn’t pinned it down. For instance if you ask them if toasters are stupid, they might be unsure.”</p>

<p>“Yes! They are unsure because they are trying to guess what the real concept is, from their limited collection of exposures to it. If it were about making one up, why would they be uncertain?”</p>

          A vastly faster vaccine rollout</a><span class="post-meta"> Jan 11, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>When a traveler introduced smallpox to New York City in 1947, the city—and in particular its health commissioner, Israel Weinstein—apparently ran an epic vaccination campaign, reaching 5 million people in the first two weeks.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> That is, four hundred thousand vaccinations per day. San Francisco in two days.</p>

<p>For covid, the first New York City vaccine <a href="https://abc7ny.com/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-pfizer-ny/8763858/">was given</a> on the 14th of December, and if I understand, by the 10th of January, twenty seven days later, 203,181 doses <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccines-new-york/mass-vaccination-sites-open-in-new-york-city-as-covid-19-batters-u-s-idUSKBN29F0NR">had reportedly been given</a>.

          The time I got really into poker</a><span class="post-meta"> Jan 11, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>One time I decided it would be good to learn to play poker. I had probably learned to play some form of poker a couple of other times before, and forgotten. One way to play a game a lot is to play it with a computer rather than other people. An iPad turns Agricola from one of the slowest games that casual board gamers might still be bothered to play to something you can play a few quick rounds of over lunch. I downloaded some kind of poker app, and began. It was maybe 9pm, and I was maybe sitting on my bed, in maybe Berkeley. My memories are pretty unclear. The app was green I think, like some kind of casino table.</p>

          A different dictionary</a><span class="post-meta"> Jan 09, 2021</span>
      </h3><p>I enjoyed James Somers <a href="https://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary">account</a> (HT <a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/12/19/thesauring.html#comment-5194868155">Liron Shapira</a>) of how Webster’s dictionary used to be much more beautiful than dictionaries today, for instance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“…Flashing differs from exploding or disploding in not being accompanied with a loud report. To glisten, or glister, is to shine with a soft and fitful luster, as eyes suffused with tears, or flowers wet with dew.”</em>
<br />
<br />
Did you see that last clause? “To shine with a soft and fitful luster, as eyes suffused with tears, or flowers wet with dew.” I’m not sure why you won’t find writing like that in dictionaries these days, but you won’t. Here is the modern equivalent of that sentence in the latest edition of the Merriam-Webster: “glisten applies to the soft sparkle from a wet or oily surface <glistening wet="" sidewalk="">.”
<br />
<br />
Who decided that the American public couldn’t handle “a soft and fitful luster”? I can’t help but think something has been lost. “A soft sparkle from a wet or oily surface” doesn’t just sound worse, it actually describes the phenomenon with less precision. In particular it misses the shimmeriness, the micro movement and action, “the fitful luster,” of, for example, an eye full of tears — which is by the way far more intense and interesting an image than “a wet sidewalk.”</glistening></p>

      </h3><p>In chess, you can’t play by picking a desired end of the game and backward chaining to the first move, because there are vastly more possible chains of moves than your brain can deal with, and the good ones are few. Instead, chess players steer by heuristic senses of the worth of situations. I assume they still back-chain a few moves (‘if I go there, she’ll have to move her rook, freeing my queen’) but just leading from a heuristically worse to a heuristically better situation a short hop away.</p>
