&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas! I got you a list of things on the internet I thought you might find interesting. No obligation to look at them. (Many things I’ve enjoyed lately are old or about history, so there’s a good chance that you have seen them or seen much better things, but oh well.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.aidungeon.io/main/landing&quot;&gt;AI dungeon&lt;/a&gt;: a text adventure written by AI in response to your responses&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/image-gpt/#completions&quot;&gt;AI can also generate coherent completions of photographs&lt;/a&gt; (See examples under ‘Completions’)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRcu-ysocX4&quot;&gt;A lecture about the Bronze Age collapse&lt;/a&gt; (I enjoyed this, though your historical understanding being thousands of times greater than mine might make it less so for you)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://slavevoyages.org/&quot;&gt;Slave voyages&lt;/a&gt;: a memorial in the form of a database of 36,000 specific slaving expeditions that took place between 1514 and 1866. Perhaps most easily appreciated in the form of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://slavevoyages.org/voyage/database#timelapse&quot;&gt;timelapse&lt;/a&gt; of the journeys (note that you can click on any dot and see the details of the ship and captives). I’m pretty impressed at them finding this much data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ia802605.us.archive.org/19/items/SenecaOnTheShortnessOfLife/Seneca%20on%20the%20Shortness%20of%20Life.pdf&quot;&gt;On the shortness of life&lt;/a&gt; (I enjoyed this, though don’t necessarily agree)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/cryonics.html&quot;&gt;How to live for much longer in expectation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://englishverse.com/poems/the_isles_of_greece&quot;&gt;The isles of Greece&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, is pretty cool looking:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Mama,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than be so bold as to give you a further object to take care of, I gathered for you a collection of things I think you might like on the internet. I CC the world, in case they are interested, or want to add anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of love,
Katja

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.positly.com/about/&quot;&gt;Positly&lt;/a&gt;: Perhaps you have enough opportunities to interview people, but if you want to run your own surveys of strangerse online, this streamlines the process a lot (i.e. you basically write some questions and put money in the slot and they handle getting strangers to answer your questions and paying them). For instance, I asked some Americans &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/11/06/why-trump.html&quot;&gt;why they voted as they did&lt;/a&gt;, and some other things about their experience of the election.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en&quot;&gt;Rijksmuseum&lt;/a&gt;: the national museum of the Netherlands has a pleasing website for their pleasing art collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that this has been utterly discredited as a reliable source of ethical advice, because it is the same one that recommended to the average person slavery as labor, and genocide as standard geopolitical strategy, and rape as prize, and torture as entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know of a clearly better source, for a typical person who isn’t a professional ethicist. But given the intense fallibility of this one, I’m inclined to say that the resulting moral views should be held with uncertainty and modesty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this I’m inclined to infer that people should not be &lt;em&gt;moralizing&lt;/em&gt; about moral disagreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do share the urge to moralize when I’m in a moral disagreement, but is this wrong?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Katja Grace</name></author><category term="ethics" /><summary type="html">Most people get their ethics from a combination of trusting what is normally done in their society and doing what they feel is right.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What is food like?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/12/22/what-is-food-like.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What is food like?" /><published>2020-12-22T03:11:37-08:00</published><updated>2020-12-22T03:11:37-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/12/22/what-is-food-like</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/12/22/what-is-food-like.html">&lt;p&gt;I have an Anki&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; deck of things I feel like a failure regarding. Instead of each card having a question that I see if I can remember the answer to, it has a potentially shameful thing that I see if I still feel bad about. Each time I look at one, as well as marking it correct to the extent that I no longer feel bad about it, I briefly do a little bit to make it better. (Learn about the thing I’m embarrassed to not know about, practice the skill that I don’t have, think about whether it’s a real problem, etc). My sense is that one can often feel bad about something for a long time which one could alternatively make marked progress on in a very short time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I drew a card marked, ‘can’t critique food’. Admittedly not the most horrifying of failures, and I don’t currently feel too bad about it, or remember writing it down. But I suppose that what I had in mind is that when people discuss the merits or subtleties of different foods and food establishments, I often feel like the topic is outside my domain, and furthermore suspect that if my strongest views of the moment were revealed—e.g. “good fries &amp;gt; bad fries » not fries”, or “I want to eat something cool and wet and I prefer it involve parsley”, or “pea protein is the worst”—I would seem childish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I read online briefly and found that Jonathan Gold is a famous food critic, then read a very small amount of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eater.com/2018/7/23/17600982/jonathan-gold-best-work-reviews-writing&quot;&gt;his writing&lt;/a&gt;. Now I will have a go at critiquing food at all, which I expect is a decent step toward being passable at it (while also fulfilling my intention to occasionally do things I haven’t done).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;On an almost empty teacup of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marysgonecrackers.com/&quot;&gt;Mary’s Gone crackers&lt;/a&gt; I found in my bedroom while cleaning up recently.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Food that you know has been sitting open on your desk for a week can be tainted by a foul flavor of unease. But my expectations for these crackers were cleansed with the fresh-toasted snap and delicate flavor of my first nibble of one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crispy things are often light and insubstantial—crunch and heft seem to often overlap in coarse, unyielding foods. Yet this Mary’s Gone cracker had both a pleasing, easy crackle and a real density. And while in no way chewy, it was good to chew: coming apart not into a wheat slurry, but into a textured rubble of seed meal, satisfying and nutty. I wanted to find the fragments lost in the corners of my mouth. I wanted to crush the last seeds with my teeth. All the while the bright taste of toasted herbs lingered, sometimes veering into a burning. Not of chili, but of flavor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then my boyfriend became available for chatting, and I chatted with him, ceasing to resist the temptation to eat virtually all of the crackers. I bit them thoughtfully as we spoke, knowing I was eating up the opportunity to critique them, but only sparing enough attention from the conversation to favor this end, on grounds that they were presently delicious.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In sum, Mary’s Gone Crackers are very good crackers, and survive surprisingly well in an uncovered teacup. If you keep a stack of them in a teacup with a somewhat but not much larger diameter, this can also be spatially pleasing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there’s a general pattern where if you value A you tend to increase the amount of it in your life, and you end feeling very positively about various opposites of A—things that are very unlike A, or partially prevent A, or undo some of A’s consequences—as well. At least some of the time, or for some parts of you, or in some aspects, or when your situation changes a bit. Especially if you contain multitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alice values openness, so tends to be very open: she tells anyone who asks (and many people who don’t) what’s going on in her life, and writes about it abundantly on the internet. But when she is embarrassed about something, she feels oppressed by everyone being able to see her so easily. So then she hides in her room, works at night when nobody is awake to think of her, and writes nothing online. Because for her, interacting with someone basically equates to showing them everything, her love of openness comes with a secondary love of being totally alone in her room.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bob values connecting with people, and it seems hard in the modern world, but he practices heartfelt listening and looking people in the eye, and mentally jumping into their perspectives. He often has meaningful conversations in the grocery line, which he enjoys and is proud of. He goes to Burning Man and finds thousands of people desperate to connect with him, so that his normal behavior is quickly leading to an onslaught of connecting that is more than he wants. He finds himself savoring the impediments to connection—the end of an eye-gazing activity, the chance to duck out of a conversation, the walls of his tent—in a way that nobody else at Burning Man is.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An extreme commitment to honesty and openness with your partner &lt;a href=&quot;https://meteuphoric.com/2010/11/10/know-thyself-vs-know-one-another/&quot;&gt;might&lt;/a&gt; leads to a secondary inclination away from honesty and openness with yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A person who loves travel also loves being at home again afterward, with a pointed passion absent from a person who is a perpetual homebody.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A person who loves jumping in ice water is more likely to also love saunas than someone who doesn’t.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A person who loves snow is more likely to love roaring fires.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A person who loves walking has really enjoyed lying down at the end of the day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A person who surrounds themselves with systems loves total abandonment of them during holiday more than he who only had an appointment calendar and an alarm clock to begin with.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A person with five children because they love children probably wants a babysitter for the evening more than the person who ambivalently had a single child.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A person who loves hanging out with people who share an interest in the principles of effective altruism is often also especially excited to hang out with people who don’t, on the occasions when they do that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A person who directs most of their money to charity is more obsessed with the possibility of buying an expensive dress than their friend who cares less about charity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A person who is so drawn to their partner’s company that they can’t stay away from them at home sometimes gets more out of solitary travel than someone more solitariness-focused in general.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A person craving danger also cares about confidence in safety mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A person who loves the sun wants sunglasses and sunscreen more than a person who stays indoors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pattern makes sense, because people and things are multifaceted, and effects are uncertain and delayed. So some aspect of you liking some aspect of a thing at some time will often mean you ramp up that kind of thing, producing effects other than the one you liked, plus more of the effect that you liked than intended because of delay. And anyway you are a somewhat different creature by then, and maybe always had parts less amenable to the desired thing anyway. Or more simply, because in systems full of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback&quot;&gt;negative feedbacks&lt;/a&gt;, effects tend to produce opposite effects, and you and the world are such systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Katja Grace</name></author><category term="meteuphoric" /><category term="psychology" /><summary type="html">Is the opposite of what you love also what you love?</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/i/katjasgrace/pexels_taryn_elliott_4231477.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/i/katjasgrace/pexels_taryn_elliott_4231477.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Theasauring</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/12/18/thesauring.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Theasauring" /><published>2020-12-18T23:10:27-08:00</published><updated>2020-12-18T23:10:27-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/12/18/thesauring</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/12/18/thesauring.html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I really enjoy opening a thesaurus.

Lately I’ve been reading Howard Zinn’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O2YH8EQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;btkr=1&quot;&gt;People’s History of the United States&lt;/a&gt;, listening to Steven Pinker’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Better-Angels-Our-Nature-Violence/dp/0670022950/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=&amp;amp;sr=&quot;&gt;the Better Angels of Our Nature&lt;/a&gt;, watching Ken Burns and Lynn Novick’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/kenburns/the-vietnam-war/home/&quot;&gt;documentary about the Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt; and watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/Webzwithaz&quot;&gt;Oversimplified&lt;/a&gt; history videos on YouTube (which I find too lighthearted for the subject matter, but if you want to squeeze extra history learning in your leisure and dessert time, compromises can be worth it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a basic feature of all this that I’m perpetually confused about: how has there been so much energy for going to war?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to explain my confusion, because in each particular case, there might be plenty of plausible motives given–someone wants ‘power’, or to ‘reunite their country’, or there is some customary enemy, or that enemy might attack them otherwise–but overall, it seems like the kind of thing people should be extremely averse to, such that even if there were plausibly good justifications, they wouldn’t just win out constantly, other justifications for not doing the thing would usually be found. Like, there are great reasons for writing epic treatises on abstract topics, but somehow, most people find that they don’t get around to it. I expect going to some huge effort to travel overseas and die in the mud to be more like that, intuitively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I’m not confused here about people fighting in defense of things they care a lot about—joining the army when their country is under attack, or joining the Allies in WWII. And I’m not confused by people who are forced to fight, by conscription or desperate need of money. It’s just that across these various sources on history, I haven’t seen much comprehensible-to-me explanation of what’s going on in the minds of the people who volunteer to go to war (or take part in smaller dangerous violence) when the stakes aren’t already at the life or death level for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also not criticizing the people whose motives I am confused by–I’m confident that I’m missing things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like if I woke up tomorrow to find that half the country was volunteering to cut off their little finger for charity, I’d be pretty surprised. And if upon inquiring, each person had something to say—about how it was a good charity, or how suffering is brave and valiant, or how their Dad did it already, or how they were being emotionally manipulated by someone else who wanted it to happen, or they how wanted to be part of something—each one might not be that unlikely, but I’d still feel overall super confused, at a high level, at there being enough total energy behind this, given that it’s a pretty costly thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the historical people heading off to war don’t feel surprising. But I feel like this is because it is taken for granted as what historical people do. Just as in stories about Christmas, it is taken for granted that Santa Clause will make and distribute billions of toys, because that’s what he does, even though his motives are actually fairly opaque. But historical people presumably had internal lives that would be recognizable to me. What did it look like from the inside, to hear that WWI was starting, and hurry to sign up? Or to volunteer for the French military in time to fight to maintain French control in Vietnam, in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Indochina_War&quot;&gt;First Indochina War&lt;/a&gt;, that preceded the Vietnam War?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d feel less surprised in a world where deadly conflict was more like cannibalism is in our world. Where yes, technically humans are edible, so if you are hungry enough you can eat them, but it is extremely rare for it to get to that, because nobody wants to be on any side of it, and they have very strong and consistent feelings about that, and if anyone really wanted to eat thousands or millions of people, say to bolster their personal or group power, it would be prohibitively expensive in terms of money or social capital to overcome the universal distaste for this idea.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Katja Grace</name></author><category term="meteuphoric" /><category term="social-science" /><summary type="html">I didn’t learn about history very well prior to my thirties somehow, but lately I’ve been variously trying to rectify this.
