&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you write a question that seems clear, there’s an unbelievably high chance that any given reader will misunderstand it. (Possibly this applies to things that aren’t survey questions also, but that’s a problem for another time.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A better way to find out if your questions are clear is to repeatedly take a single individual person, and sit down with them, and ask them to take your survey while narrating the process: reading the questions aloud, telling you what they think the question is asking, explaining their thought process in answering it. If you do this repeatedly with different people until some are not confused at all, the questions are probably clear.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you ask people very similar questions in different sounding ways, you can get very different answers (possibly related to the above, though that’s not obviously the main thing going on).&lt;!--ex--&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One specific case of that: for some large class of events, if you ask people how many years until a 10%, 50%, 90% chance of event X occurring, you will get an earlier distribution of times than if you ask the probability that X will happen in 10, 20, 50 years. (I’ve only tried this with AI related things, but my guess is that it at least generalizes to other low-probability-seeming things. Also, if you just ask about 10% on its own, it is consistently different from 10% alongside 50% and 90%.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Given the complicated landscape of people’s beliefs about the world and proclivities to say certain things, there is a huge amount of scope for choosing questions to get answers that sound different to listeners (e.g. support a different side in a debate).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is also scope for helping people think through a thing in a way that they would endorse, e.g. by asking a sequence of questions. This can also change what the answer sounds like, but seems ethical to me, whereas applications of 5 seem generally suss.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Often your respondent knows thing P and you want to know Q, and it is possible to infer something about Q from P. You then have a choice about which point in this inference chain to ask the person about. It seems helpful to notice this choice. For instance, if AI researchers know most about what AI research looks like, and you want to know whether human civilization will be imminently destroyed by renegade AI systems, you can ask about a) how fast AI progress appears to be progressing, b) when it will reach a certain performance bar, c) whether AI will cause something like human extinction. In the 2016 survey, we asked all of these.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Given the choice, if you are hoping to use the data as information, it is often good to ask people about things they know about. In 7, this points to aiming your question early in the reasoning chain, then doing the inference yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interest in surveys doesn’t seem very related to whether a survey is a good source of information on the topic surveyed on. One of the strongest findings of the 2016 survey IMO was that surveys like that are unlikely to be a reliable guide to the future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This makes sense because surveys fulfill other purposes. Surveys are great if you want to know what people think about X, rather than what is true about X. Knowing what people think is often the important question. It can be good for legitimizing a view, or letting a group of people have common knowledge about what they think so they can start to act on it, including getting out of bad equilibria where everyone nominally supports claim P because they think others will judge them if not.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are surveying people with the intention of claiming a thing, it is helpful to think ahead about what you want to claim, and make sure you ask questions that will let you claim that, in a simple way. For instance, it is better to be able to say ‘80% of a random sample of shoppers at Tesco said that they like tomato more than beans’ than to say ‘80% of a sample of shoppers who were mostly at Tesco but also at Aldi (see footnote for complicated shopper selection process) say that they prefer tomato to peas, or (using a separate subset of shoppers) prefer peas to beans, from which we can infer that probably about 80% of shoppers in general, or more, prefer tomato to beans’. You want to be able to describe the setup and question in a way that is simple enough that the listener understands what happened, and see the significance of the finding.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are running a survey multiple times, and you want informative answers about whether there were differences in views between those times, you should probably run exactly the same survey and not change the questions even a tiny bit unless there is very strong reason to. This follows from 3.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Qualtrics costs thousands of dollars to use, and won’t let you sign up for an account or even know how much it might cost unless you book a meeting to talk to someone to sell it to you. &lt;a href=&quot;http://guidedtrack.com/&quot;&gt;Guidedtrack.com&lt;/a&gt; seems pretty nice, but I might not have been trying to do such complicated things there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Running surveys seems underrated as an activity.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI Impacts just finished collecting data from a new survey of ML researchers, as similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiimpacts.org/2016-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/&quot; data-type=&quot;post&quot; data-id=&quot;753&quot;&gt;2016 one&lt;/a&gt; as practical, aside from a couple of new questions that seemed too interesting not to add.&lt;!--ex--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aiimpacts.org/2022-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/&quot; data-type=&quot;post&quot; data-id=&quot;3246&quot;&gt;This page&lt;/a&gt; reports on it preliminarily, and we’ll be adding more details there. But so far, some things that might interest you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;37 years until a 50% chance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiimpacts.org/2022-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/#Definitions&quot;&gt;HLMI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;according to a complicated aggregate forecast (and biasedly not including data from questions about the conceptually similar Full Automation of Labor, which in 2016 prompted strikingly later estimates)&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; This 2059 aggregate HLMI timeline has become about eight years shorter in the six years since 2016, when the aggregate prediction was 2061, or 45 years out. Note that all of these estimates are conditional on &amp;#8220;human scientific activity continu[ing] without major negative disruption.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P(extremely bad outcome)=5%&lt;/strong&gt; The median respondent believes the probability that the long-run effect of advanced AI on humanity will be &amp;#8220;extremely bad (e.g., human extinction)&amp;#8221; is 5%. This is the same as it was in 2016 (though Zhang et al 2022 found 2% in a similar but non-identical question). Many respondents put the chance substantially higher: 48% of respondents gave at least 10% chance of an extremely bad outcome. Though another 25% put it at 0%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explicit P(doom)=5-10% &lt;/strong&gt;The levels of badness involved in that last question seemed ambiguous in retrospect, so I added two new questions about human extinction explicitly. The median respondent&amp;#8217;s probability of x-risk from humans failing to control AI&lt;span id=&quot;easy-footnote-1-3250&quot; class=&quot;easy-footnote-margin-adjust&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;easy-footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#easy-footnote-bottom-1-3250&quot; title=&quot;Or, &amp;amp;#8216;human inability to control future advanced AI systems causing human extinction or similarly permanent and severe disempowerment of the human species&amp;amp;#8217;&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was 10%, weirdly more than median chance of human extinction from AI in general&lt;span id=&quot;easy-footnote-2-3250&quot; class=&quot;easy-footnote-margin-adjust&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;easy-footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#easy-footnote-bottom-2-3250&quot; title=&quot;That is, &amp;amp;#8216;future AI advances causing human extinction or similarly permanent and severe disempowerment of the human species&amp;amp;#8217;&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, at 5%. This might just be because different people got these questions and the median is quite near the divide between 5% and 10%. The most interesting thing here is probably that these are both very high—it seems the &amp;#8216;extremely bad outcome&amp;#8217; numbers in the old question were not just catastrophizing merely disastrous AI outcomes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for AI safety research is up&lt;/strong&gt;: 69% of respondents believe society should prioritize AI safety research &amp;#8220;more&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;much more&amp;#8221; than it is currently prioritized, up from 49% in 2016. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The median respondent thinks there is an &amp;#8220;about even chance&amp;#8221; that an argument given for an intelligence explosion is broadly correct.&lt;/strong&gt; The median respondent also believes machine intelligence will probably (60%) be &amp;#8220;vastly better than humans at all professions&amp;#8221; within 30 years of HLMI, and that the rate of global technological improvement will probably (80%) dramatically increase (e.g., by a factor of ten) as a result of machine intelligence within 30 years of HLMI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Years/probabilities framing effect persists: &lt;/strong&gt;if you ask people for probabilities of things occurring in a fixed number of years, you get later estimates than if you ask for the number of years until a fixed probability will obtain. This looked very robust in 2016, and shows up again in the 2022 HLMI data. Looking at just the people we asked for years, the aggregate forecast is 29 years, whereas it is 46 years for those asked for probabilities. (We haven&amp;#8217;t checked in other data or for the bigger framing effect yet.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictions vary a lot&lt;/strong&gt;. Pictured below: the attempted reconstructions of people&amp;#8217;s probabilities of HLMI over time, which feed into the aggregate number above. There are few times and probabilities that someone doesn&amp;#8217;t basically endorse the combination of.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can download the data&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u_qcG6erXkH4EJgygl2fpkpJENAv6-kFWJejsw1oA1Q/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (slightly cleaned and anonymized) and do your own analysis.

  &lt;p&gt;Individual inferred gamma distributions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey had a lot of questions (randomized between participants to make it a reasonable length for any given person), so this blog post doesn’t cover much of it. A bit more is on &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiimpacts.org/2022-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/&quot; data-type=&quot;post&quot; data-id=&quot;3246&quot;&gt;the page&lt;/a&gt; and more will be added. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to many people for help and support with this project! (Many but probably not all listed on the survey page.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;aside&quot;&gt;Spoiler warning: spoilers for The Passenger by Lisa Lutz, and In the Cart, by Anton Chekhov.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I took up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26154406-the-passenger&quot;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; looking for a page-turner. It was, but hours before the end I thought its main contribution to my mental life would be the visceral knowledge that page-turners can be undelicious. It felt cold, and getting into its world felt bad. The protagonist slunk around dark and uncomfortable places, killing people, scheming harshly, perceiving low beams as dangers to the heads of tall men, and that sort of thing. With some amount of fretting about what she was becoming. I wanted to turn the pages, but I also kind of wanted it to end, and for me to read something more squarely enjoyable next time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--ex--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then the end was different, and kept coming back to me in the day, and turned the rest around and gave it new meaning. Like the image of a long dark tunnel becomes something different if you step away and see that it starts in the loveliest of fields. After a long dark tunnel of a book, we turn around and see where the heroine came from, and her teenage innocence and goodness newly fills out the potentially empty person we have been watching. And her past isn’t really discordant—I think I just wrote her off fast. This endless night began in that day, and seeing so makes the full picture both warm and intense, where it had seemed like cheap suspense and violence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In that abstract description, I suppose it is a bit like ‘In The Cart’ by Chekhov: we watch a dreary life, then at last that life is pulled into a perspective where we see its warm and hopeful start, unreachably distant. And it changes the flavor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have not much idea if what I saw was what Lisa Lutz was going for, but if she was, and if other readers are like me (haha) then I think having 85% of the book be unpleasant was probably called for.

  &lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be “groupstruck”? How does groupstruck-ness differ from the bystander effect, normalcy bias, and other related cognitive biases? How do we break people out of being groupstruck? What does it mean to be a “bounded” person? How can we build up better decision-making heuristics? What sorts of decisions do people usually not quantify but should (and vice versa)? How can we make rational relationship decisions without coming across as “calculating” or cold?

What does it mean to be a “bounded” person? How can we build up better decision-making heuristics? What sorts of decisions do people usually not quantify but should (and vice versa)? How can we make rational relationship decisions without coming across as “calculating” or cold? How does anthropic reasoning affect our hypotheses about the nature of the universe and life within it (i.e., the Fermi paradox, the simulation hypothesis, etc.)?

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how much of Twitter activity this accounts for (apparently &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/975884635535101952&quot;&gt;Michael Nielsen enjoys an entirely different place&lt;/a&gt;, and my experience seems pretty nice too). But I think there’s a real pattern of this kind, which makes game theoretic sense, and goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People say things&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People read these things&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If anything seems objectionable to any of these people, then they repost those things with commentary, and everyone else reads them extra.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the next round, people (or the ones who who get attention) say objectionable things (that they expect will get attention), about objectionable things (that they have their attention on from the last round)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To lay out the effects of all this more clearly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People disproportionately read things they don’t like, which is presumably bad for them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People get the visceral sense that others are disproportionately writing things they don’t like, which is misleading, and not in a helpful-for-public-friendship way&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Things people don’t like get extra space in the public conversation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People who tend to write things that others don’t like get extra power and attention instead of less&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Writing things other people don’t like is incentivized (if you want attention, writing things other people don’t like is probably somewhat better than writing things people do like, and way better than writing things they don’t feel strongly about).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supposing something like this model is true, and bad, it seems to me that there is a really simple solution: &lt;strong&gt;add a dislike button.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, what if when a person sees a thing they don’t like, instead of broadcasting it to others, they register their disapproval by quietly clicking a different button next to the heart, and then Twitter shows it to other people less instead of more? You can still retweet it if you especially want other people to see it more, but adding attention wouldn’t be the default disapproval vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an original idea, and the other major websites that do it have not, to my knowledge, been run out of business by a dearth of disagreement. I think they are also not so much known for the above dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I posit that a Twitter downvote button would be great. What am I missing?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Katja Grace</name></author><category term="advice" /><category term="institutiondesign" /><category term="twitter" /><summary type="html">The popular story of Twitter’s role in the ruin of civilization is that it is a runaway trash fire of reciprocal anger and offense, where otherwise nice people are possessed by overwhelming outrages, and drawn into throwing their own energy behind creating the vilest and most vindictive responses to what they see, turning away from reason and hurting others in turn, and so the place continues.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/i/katjasgrace/downvote2.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/i/katjasgrace/downvote2.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Fighting in various places for a really long time</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2022/05/10/fighting-for-a-really-long-time.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fighting in various places for a really long time" /><published>2022-05-10T18:24:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-05-10T18:24:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2022/05/10/fighting-for-a-really-long-time</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2022/05/10/fighting-for-a-really-long-time.html">&lt;p&gt;The first time someone raved to me about seeing Everything Everywhere All at Once, I thought they were actually suggesting I see everything everywhere all at once, and I was briefly excited by the implication that this exhilarating possibility was somehow on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that disappointment I heard about it several times more, and warmed to the idea of seeing the movie anyway, especially on account of it being the most roundly recommended one I remember. The third time someone invited me to see it with them, I went.&lt;!--ex--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it seemed so astonishingly lacking to both of us that I left severely confused, and remain so. Like: I know people have different tastes. I know that I’m not the biggest movie appreciator (my ideal movie probably has a small number of visually distinct characters and nobody dies or does anything confusing, and I’ve already seen it twice). But usually I have some abstract guess about what other people are liking. Or, more realistically, a name for the category of mysterious attraction (“ah yes, you are into the ‘action’, and that means it’s good when helicopters crash or people shoot each other”). Yet here, I’m grasping even for that. “You like it because.. it has much more prolonged fighting than usual and you like fighting?…or…it is some kind of irony thing about other movies?” I could believe that it was some kind of mediocre action movie. But usually my friends don’t go crazy for mediocre action movies. And here for instance one of my best friends, who I generally take to have subtle and sensitive and agreeable tastes, and who knows me extremely well, told &lt;em&gt;me in particular&lt;/em&gt; to see it. And the strongest criticism I have seen of it outside of our post-movie discussion is another friend’s apparently sincere complaint on Facebook that it is probably only among the top hundred movies ever, not the top ten like people say. And it’s not that I just wasn’t wowed by it: it’s hard to remember the last time I was less compelled by a movie. (Though perhaps one doesn’t remember such things.) Like, I was really sitting there in the cinema thinking something along the lines of, ‘movies usually grab my attention somehow, yet this is doing some special thing differently to not have that happen? Huh?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if I can spoil this movie, because whatever was good in it, I totally missed. But here I attempt spoilers. This is what happens in the movie, as far as I can tell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Ok my companion and I actually failed to notice when it started, so maybe there was something important there. Oops.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A woman and her family run a laundromat, and are also working on their taxes. Her life is disappointing to her. A version of her husband appears from a different dimension and relays some kind of dimly coherent plot involving lots of dimensions and the need for her to jump between them and fight or something. Then they fight and jump between dimensions for about two hours. Their fighting involves some repeating motifs: 1) There is a humorous conceit that in order to jump between dimensions you have to do a strange action, for instance bite off and chew some lip balm. This joke is repeated throughout most of the fighting. One time the traveler has to put an object up their bottom, so that is pretty exciting humorwise. 2) Things often look cool. Like, there are lots of evocative objects and people are wearing make-up and neat costumes. 3) There is lots of jumping between dimensions. At some point it becomes clear that a baddie is actually the woman’s daughter, who has turned to nihilism as a result of either seeing everything all at once and that being kind of intrinsically nihilism-provoking due to its lack of permitting anything else, or as a result of having her lesbianism disrespected by her mother earlier. The fighting takes on a more nihilism vs. appreciating life flavor, and then it turns out that being friendly and warm is good, as represented by the father, and now appreciated by the mother. Then…actually I forget what happens at the end, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m all for ‘nihilism vs. something something existential something something, life, kindness’ as a theme, but this seemed like such a shallow treatment of it. It just seemed like a bunch of fighting labeled ‘deep plot about nihilism etc’, and I don’t think caused me to have any interesting thoughts about such themes, except perhaps by reminding me of the general topic and leaving me without anything to distract my mind from wandering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was clearly too violent for my liking, so that’s idiosyncratic, but it’s not like I’m always opposed to violence—some of the fighting in Lord of the Rings was quite moving, and I watched the whole of Game of Thrones in spite of also at other times using scenes from it in exposure therapy. But I posit that you need some sort of meaningful context to make violence interesting or moving, and I don’t think I caught that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also speculate that some humor is meant to come from the protagonist being a middle aged immigrant Chinese woman, instead of the more standard young man. Which seems rude: as though it is asking for the props generally offered for featuring atypical demographics in films, yet is doing so as a joke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, it seemed to me to be a bunch of fairly meaningless fighting interspersed with repetitive lowbrow humor and aesthetically pleasing props.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked a couple of my friends to explain their alternate takes to me, but I don’t think I can do their explanations justice, due to not really understanding them. At a high level they disagreed with me about things like ‘was it extremely humorous?’ and ‘was it unusually engaging vs. unusually unengaging?’, but I didn’t understand why, at a lower level. Probably we all agree that it was visually cool, but I wasn’t actually stunned by that. Maybe visual attractiveness alone counts for less with me (though I recently saw Everything is Illuminated, which I found awesome in a confusingly soul-electrifying way and whose merit seems somehow related to visualness). One interesting thing that this discussion with EEAAO appreciators added was the point that there is something moving about the thought that in a different dimension you and the odious tax lady might be tender lovers. I agree that that’s a nice thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am hesitant to criticize here, because it is sweet of my friends to try to give me a nice movie recommendation, and I appreciate it. Also, I think in general that if Alice loves a thing and Bob doesn’t, it is much more likely that Bob is missing something wonderful than that Alice is imagining such a thing. (Though conversely if they agree that the thing is pretty good in ways, and Bob just hates it because it also has some overriding problem, then my guess would be the reverse: probably Alice is missing a thing.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So probably, somehow, other people are right. Please other people, help enlighten me more? (And thanks to some of my friends for trying!)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Katja Grace</name></author><category term="review" /><category term="culture" /><summary type="html">The first time someone raved to me about seeing Everything Everywhere All at Once, I thought they were actually suggesting I see everything everywhere all at once, and I was briefly excited by the implication that this exhilarating possibility was somehow on the table.

And due to the bubbliness of society, I don’t actually seem to know unvaccinated people to ask about it. So in the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2022/02/04/long-covid-survey-2.html&quot;&gt;covid survey&lt;/a&gt; I ran, I asked people who hadn’t had covid (and thus for whom I didn’t have more pressing questions) whether they were vaccinated, and if not why not. (Note though that these people are 20-40 years old, so not at huge risk of death.)&lt;!--ex--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their responses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I don’t think I need it, I don’t think covid is a big deal, I don’t think the vaccine works and the more the government/media pushes it the more I don’t want to ever get it.  It should be a private decision between someone and their doctor, not Joe Biden and CNN saying comply or be kicked out of society.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I still dont trust the information and safety claims made by the crooked FDA and CDC. Needs more research and study.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I had a scary vaccine reaction previously.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I am only 32 years old and in decent health so I think I would be fine if I caught COVID. It has almost been two years since the pandemic started and I haven’t gotten sick besides some minor colds. I would rather rely on natural immunity instead of the vaccine.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;dont want one
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Other health issues where my Doctor wants me to wait to get vaccinated.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I think it is poison at worst and ineffective at best. Also the way the pushed it came off like a homeless man trying to lure me into an ally. The vaccine issue has made me lose 100% trust and faith in media and government i do not believe or trust anything from them anymore
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I have anxiety problems and other health issues.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I‚Äôm actually scheduled to get a vaccination, I‚Äôm simply waiting for my appointment date.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The places where the vaccination is available are always crowded and I am somewhat afraid of being outdoors or indoors in large crowds for too long these days.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I am extremely skeptical of this “vaccine”, which has been proven ineffective (vaccinated people keep getting it, and what’s with all of the boosters?!) and has caused too many deaths and/or serious health issues/emergencies. I’ll take my chances on Covid any day over a “vaccine” that magically appeared from 8+ pharmaceutical companies in such an astonishingly short time. That is unheard of, and there is no way to know what is really in it, and what kind of problems those who are ignorant and fearful enough to get it will face later on down the road (that is, if they don’t die from the “vaccinations” themselves. The fact that the government has bribed, coerced, and is trying to FORCE everyone to get this “vaccine” is unprecedented, and quite frankly terrifying and sinister to me. I will NEVER allow a forced injection of god knows what into my own body, as that is wrong in every way there is. Vaccines allegedly keep those who get them safe from contracting whatever it is the vaccine is made for, so why would it be anyone’s business whether or not someone else is vaccinated? The Let’s Go Brandon administration and the dumbocrats that were fearmongering before the administration was even in place have done this by design. Spread fear, mistrust, and divisiveness, and lock people down to isolate them and make them suspicious and fearful of one another. Divide and conquer, because the fascist wannabe communists know that it is the only way to indulge their scummy self-serving agendas. United we stand.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;For health reasons.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I’m not at high risk, so I don’t need it immediately. Waiting to see how effective it is.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I don’t think it’s efficient…the prospect of being jabbed by endless boosters doesn’t appeal to me
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I’ve never had covid.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I don’t trust the vaccine and have not have gotten covid since the pandemic started. Plus all of the misinformation surrounding covid, from the news media to social media sites. I just don’t know what to believe anymore but I feel that not getting vaccinated is the best option for me.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I am still skeptical of the vaccine since people are still catching covid and its variants
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;It doesn’t stop the transmission, or stop you from getting covid.  I am at low risk anyways.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I am at very low risk of infection as I do not work and wouldn’t accept any non-remote work. I also do not have any friends or family in the state where I moved to last year and I do not drink so I don’t go out to bars or events, or even restaurants.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I simply have no trust in the big pharmacy and little more in the government. Throw in the fact that the vaccine was created too quickly and while it claims to have lowered infection rates and the severity of COVID-19, I’ve known several people who have been infected and they were fully vaccinated. In addition, I’ve seen many news articles reporting the same. Why should I receive a vaccine that provides such weak protection?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Transportation and access. If a pill form or some self-administering option were available, I would.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I don’t trust it.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I have chosen not to take the vaccine
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Because I think its the Governments agenda to start killing people. I don’t trust Big Pharma or the Government. Also, people still get covid with the vaccine, seems like a waste of time.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I live in Ohio, kinda wanna die. Also, it doesnt even dent the new variants; you still ge tit.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;do not trust them
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Because I believe that the vaccine is part of a either depopulation plan, or a tracking device. Either way there is no logical reason to get it.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I am hesitant because of the possible side effects long-term because not much is known about it.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I don‚Äôt see the benefit since I am not really at risk from covid.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;It’s against my religion.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I don’t need a covid vaccination.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I’m concerned about possible serious side effects from the vaccine that may show up some time down the road.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Normally, I would consider it, but the talk of forced mandates has really soured me to it. I dont believe in taking away people’s health freedoms like that. I think it’s an insane intursion on civil liberties, and I fear if we all just accept it, we will become like Australia
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I only leave the house once or twice a week so it never really felt necessary to me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest themes mentioned here seem to be distrust or hostility regarding the government and media and their various pro-vaccination pressurings, and the impression that the vaccine doesn’t work. (I wonder how much that one is relative to an expectation of ‘very occasional breakthrough cases’ that one might also trace to someone’s questionable communication choices.) An unspoken theme is arguably being in possession of relatively little information (like, what’s going on with the person who is still waiting to find out if the vaccines are effective? And do people just not know that the vaccine reduces the downside of covid, even if it is still possible to get it? Or do all of these people know things I don’t?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if much good could be done in this kind of situation with some kind of clearly independent and apolitical personal policy research institution, who prioritized being trustworthy and accurate. Like, I don’t trust the government or media especially either on this, but I and people I do trust have a decent amount of research capacity and familiarity with things like academic papers, so we arguably have an unusually good shot at figuring out the situation without having to make reference to the government or media much (assuming there aren’t more intense conspiracies afoot, in which case we will end up dead or tracking-deviced, I suppose). If I wasn’t in such a position, I feel like I’d pay a decent amount for someone to think about such things for me. I guess this is related to the service that doctors are meant to provide, though the thing I imagine would look very different to real doctors in practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Katja Grace</name></author><category term="meteuphoric" /><category term="covid" /><category term="survey" /><summary type="html">I’ve been fairly confused by the popularity in the US of remaining unvaccinated, in the face of seemingly a non-negligible, relatively immediate personal chance of death or intense illness. And due to the bubbliness of society, I don’t actually seem to know unvaccinated people to ask about it. So in the recent covid survey I ran, I asked people who hadn’t had covid (and thus for whom I didn’t have more pressing questions) whether they were vaccinated, and if not why not. (Note though that these people are 20-40 years old, so not at huge risk of death.)</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/i/katjasgrace/daniel-schludi-mAGZNECMcUg-unsplash.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/i/katjasgrace/daniel-schludi-mAGZNECMcUg-unsplash.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Bernal Heights: acquisition of a bicycle</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2022/02/09/bernal-bicycle.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bernal Heights: acquisition of a bicycle" /><published>2022-02-09T11:46:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-02-09T11:46:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2022/02/09/bernal-bicycle</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2022/02/09/bernal-bicycle.html">&lt;p&gt;The measure of a good bicycle, according to me, is that you can’t ride it without opening your mouth in joy and occasionally exclaiming things like ‘fuck yeah bicycle’. This is an idiosyncratic spec, and I had no reason to think  that it might be fulfilled by any electric bicycle—a genre I was new to—so while I intended to maybe search through every electric bicycle in The New Wheel for one that produced irrepressible, physically manifest joy, I also expected this to likely fail, and to be meanwhile embarrassingly inexplicable and irritating to bike shop employees—people who often expect one’s regard for bikes to map fairly well to facts about their price, frame shape, and whether the gears are Shimano. But several bikes in, when I uncomfortably explained to a guy there that, while the ones I had tried so far were nice, bicycles had been known to make me, like, very happy, he said of course we should find the bicycle that I loved. So I at least felt somewhat supported in my ongoing disruption of his colleague’s afternoon, with requests that bicycle after bicycle be brought out for me to pedal around the streets of Bernal Heights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guy would maneuver each bike out of the crowded shop and to the sidewalk, and adjust it to fit me, and we would chat, often about his suggestion that I maybe ride up to the hill on the other side of the main road. Which I would agree might be a good idea, before riding off, deciding that turning left was too hard, and heading in the other direction, through back streets and around a swooping circle park with a big ring road, where I would loop a few times if the mood took me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some bicycles were heavy, and rode like refrigerators. Most bicycles were unsteady, and urged even my cycling-seasoned bottom to the seat while pedaling. Most bicycles added considerable assistance to going up hills.  Many bicycles seemed fine.&lt;!--ex--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bernal Heights, on the other hand, seemed awesome. As I paused before my habitual turn-in-the-wrong-direction one time, the house kitty-corner to me was playing music louder than I recall ever hearing anything play music that wasn’t a large-concert speaker. It was truly not considerate. And a middle-aged guy on my corner was having a great time, laughing, and was like, ‘Welcome to Cortland Avenue’. I pulled up and said that I hadn’t been here before actually, and didn’t know what he was talking about. He explained that Cortland Avenue was some kind of peaceful and placid place, and that they could use more of whatever this was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole street felt old-fashioned-okay somehow, and not really like my sense of modern America. I wanted to say it was a bit like the 80s in Hobart (the capital city of Tasmania, where I grew up) but since I’ve barely experienced the 80s in Hobart, I probably shouldn’t say that. Nothing shiny, nothing preying. Yellow things, sincere things, people who care about rock music, people who bought some vegetables, people talking to friends in streets and outdoor restaurants. So many electric bicycles—do I just not notice all the electric bicycles when I’m not on one? On one outing from the shop, a woman called out to me to say that she had also tried the bicycle that I was now riding, the other day, and wasn’t it good? I pulled up to tell her that I was actually struggling to find the ‘on’ switch, and she showed it to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(To be clear, I converse with strangers in streets quite rarely in my normal life about three miles away.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a headache from all the bike-trying, and requested a lunch pause. Then I explored further down the street, and found a dineresque crêperie. I was practicing making imperfect choices fast, so in an uncharacteristic snap of decision I went in to get a lemon sugar crepe (which is only a potentially imperfect choice on axes other than deliciousness).  The place was some kind of institution, and the man behind the counter seemed to be savoring the motions of crepe-provision. I had fun ordering, and sat outside. It was so nice there that I repeatedly tried to photograph it, but it wasn’t a kind of niceness that my phone could capture it seemed. Perhaps the fact that I was sitting in the street and didn’t look mildly distressed would convey something to an experienced viewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the bike shop, I had a bike in mind for if no amazing bike materialized, and continued working through the tail of the bike options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there was an amazing bike. There was not much visual foreshadowing of this: it was an unsleek thing, painted in an impure grey with questionable red highlights. But it felt like freedom. I could stand up on it. It moved as an extension of my body. An extension full of energy and exhilaration. My smile became round with delight and I swore gleefully. I rocketed up steep streets and to the circle park. I flew around it, elated, bumping over speed bumps, pedaling passionately around the upward side and flying down around the down. Then after quite a relatively long investigation into a bike for which there was no actual open question, I made my way back to the shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said I’d buy it.  They looked at their records, and their back storage, and their records and determined that they didn’t have one to sell. This was the floor bike, for trying, and not to be sold. Though they had a slightly bigger red one to sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They carefully measured me, with a platform and a springed thing between my thighs and such, and determined that the red one was actually the right size for me, and the one I had ridden was too small. I wasn’t meant to ride the red one because it was a new bike for selling, not a floor model. But they would let me take it out a little anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was nice. Was it as nice as the other one? I didn’t know—it seemed maybe less nice, but also now that I was obsessively paying attention to signs of ineffable goodness, and worried, I was probably just having less fun, no fault of the bike. It was basically the same as my perfect bike, but the right size, and possible to buy, and more beautiful, and not obviously less awesome, so probably I should get it and stop engaging in such fun-dampening neurosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back. Then it occurred to me that I could still try that grey bike one more time. I did. It was awesome. It seemed obviously better than the red bike. It didn’t matter if I was caught in some tangle of neuroses: such joy would not be smothered. I stopped by the road and relayed my problem by text to my boyfriend, who wisely started googling for other stores that might have such a bike. Then I took photographs of the bike from all sides in the sun by the park. Then my phone with connectivity died. (For reasons to do with my own forgetfulness re phone charging and complications of phone plans, I had brought two phones: one with power, and one with connectivity.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rode around and mentally rehearsed purchasing the floor bike. Did they need a floor bike for which they have no actual corresponding salable bikes? I’d pay as much as for a new bike. I’d pay more. They would be astonished and grateful. I’d talk to the manager, who would be free to disregard floor bike protocol, for such an exceptional case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to the store.  No, they would not sell me the floor bike. It didn’t belong to them. I could buy it in months, when floor bikes get replaced or something. I was also told: don’t do that—I hadn’t seen what the customers did to floor bikes. (What could customers possibly be doing to floor bikes to warrant such fear?) ‘Months’ was also about how long it would take them to order in a new bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They let me use their wifi, and I reached my boyfriend again with my charged phone, and he had actually phoned a bunch of bike shops, like some kind of hero (or some kind of superhero with the ability to just talk to people in shops on the phone—if I phoned a bike shop, they might say something like “phh shu anganga mph ghe?” and I’d say I couldn’t hear them, but they wouldn’t hear me, and we’d go back and forth like that a few times, until it became too embarrassing to be borne). He had located a couple of very similar bikes, possibly one of them identical, at other bike shops in San Francisco and nearby Berkeley. I decided to go home and charge my phone, and so ended my and The New Wheel’s long afternoon together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home, I charged my phone and acknowledged my failings re phone charging, and bravely acted on my boyfriend’s claim that it would be reasonable to just phone the most promising bike shop back to check it really was the same bike they had, before spending over an hour driving to Berkeley. It also became apparent that my other boyfriend would not hate taking me on a long bicycle-pursuing excursion in his car that evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we set out, me feeling kind of defensive and silly, because I could have got a bike that was better on every front except for ‘ineffable greatness’ hours earlier and with a lot less bothering other people. I vaguely attempted to defend myself as we went over the bridge, but it didn’t seem very necessary, and we got on to more interesting conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bike shop, it turned out, was a few doors away from a house I used to live in, between a coffee shop with romantic memories, and a bench with different romantic memories, from multiple ancient times. Stepping into the thick past, I left my boyfriend to park the car and walked up to the new shop. It was a big warmly lit warehouse room, which I didn’t remember seeing when I lived here. Friendly: a place of children in baskets and wholesome rolled-up-trouser types. I read out the string identifying my desires to a plump, friendly man: “Gazelle ultimate T10+ 46inch”. He went looking for the corresponding item amidst the central sea of handlebars and frames. He couldn’t find it. Strange. He consulted his records, and the back storage, and his records, and another bike shop man. At last, it was right there—the problem had been that the record said that the bike was ‘dust’ colored, and he understandably hadn’t considered that someone would come up with that name for my beloved bike’s reddish-grey tone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relieved but further paranoid for the preservation of the hard-to-measure magic, I got out my photographs from earlier, and asked him if there was anything different between the photograph and this bike. There was! The other bike had had some kind of fancy suspension seat post installed. They had the same for sale, so I asked for it. I rode the bike around half the block and back, and couldn’t tell if it was amazing, but it really was a short and constrained ride, and what more could I reasonably do? I bought it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could barely push its giant, heavy body into the back of the car, and it made an alarming cracking sound, which hopefully was just the light changing position. We took it home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another day, I took it out for a little ride, and it was great to power up the hills of San Francisco, and shoot along the flats. It’s the kind of bike that only adds power when you pedal, so it seemed that riding was still a lot of exercise, but your exertions got you all around the city, instead of half way up the nearest hill. And while I just meant to have a little ride, I went further around the city than I may have ever been on a single outing. What had been an intractable country of mountainous slopes and distances and intersections like war zones was shrunk to my scale. And I felt safer, though faster, because usually getting out of the way of things requires my own feeble strength, which might be completely overcome by starting on a little bit of a bump or something. Now I could more move when I wanted. And I could go fast enough to feel no guilt riding in the middle of the car lane, rather than the door-prone bicycle lane. I was as about as fast as cars, and nimble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to admit though that it wasn’t the joy I had sought so hard. It was merely mundanely good. And I was tense, and San Francisco was frightening, and cars were everywhere, and it was all exhausting. Maybe now I was just too stressed, and it would be good later? Or maybe the bike was somehow adjusted slightly wrong, and the potential for that same joy could never be found among the myriad possible positional combinations? About twenty minutes from home, I realized that I actually couldn’t leave the bike and walk without my back hurting a lot. So, questionably, I got back on it, which was bearable, and rode home. I spent the next day or so in bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shorter rides favored the hypothesis that it was fun but not extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I returned to the first bike shop, and asked a man there to adjust my new bike to be exactly like their floor bike, ignoring the very likely possibility that they had adjusted the floor bike since my visit. He didn’t seem to obviously understand either the situation or my request, but was willing to make some changes, and phone me when done. He also sold me an expensive lock and some neat (and expensive) panniers. I went and tried to buy crepes, but the store was closed. But then I found a cafe and a restaurant next door to each other with back patios, a recent passion of mine, and took a nice iced coffee from one to the other, where I ate fries and read about words for an hour, in the company of a cat, someone else reading a book, and some kind of raw European music. It was pretty good. My phone died, because my life is too complicated and/or I’m an idiot. I went back to the bike store. He had changed some things, such as—promisingly—the angle of the handlebars. I rode home via the circle park, detouring to fly around it, iced coffee lodged in my front gear cables. It seemed amazing. But I’m uncertain, and doesn’t that mean it wasn’t? Well I smiled a lot on the way home, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Katja Grace</name></author><category term="worldlypositions" /><category term="bernalheights" /><category term="mundane" /><summary type="html">The measure of a good bicycle, according to me, is that you can’t ride it without opening your mouth in joy and occasionally exclaiming things like ‘fuck yeah bicycle’.
