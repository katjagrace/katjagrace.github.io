from old websites&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thin cardboard box&lt;br /&gt;
with pictures of face creams&lt;br /&gt;
now roaming nearby&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handful of tissues&lt;br /&gt;
collected from drifts&lt;br /&gt;
many tears and lunches&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Careful library&lt;br /&gt;
of things&lt;br /&gt;
I haven’t gotten around to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where would I keep this&lt;br /&gt;
very big pad of paper&lt;br /&gt;
if I were Critch?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t eat the pepparkakor&lt;br /&gt;

I did and regret nothing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This potential for embarrassment seems interesting. Especially where the main cost of precautions is the social stigma.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; What exactly is the stigma stigmatizing? Being so concerned about a widely-acknowledged-to-be-worth-a-lot-to-avoid disease that you are willing to risk social stigma? Why should you be embarrassed by evaluating a disease as worse than social stigma? Couldn’t it just be that you don’t expect the social stigma to be that bad? Is there some equilibrium size of social stigma implied by such a situation? (Or even if you evaluate the disease to be bad, isn’t that pretty clearly demonstrated by now?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I’m not sure I have heard anyone other than the president of America mock someone else’s PPE, so it’s unclear where I got the impression that it is embarrassing. It doesn’t seem to be an entirely idiosyncratic impression. It was worse at the outset - I remember the day San Francisco first locked down, I went out one last time to buy some things wearing a mask, and I felt painfully silly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pragmatically, if I feel embarrassed wearing a lot of PPE, I think about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how I’m correct, and anyone judging me is wrong&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how they can’t see my face now anyway, especially if I add some more PPE&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how it seems genuinely pitiable to be cowed into risking your life by the possibility of strangers (who are wrong) laughing at you. Then I feel sad for the people who would judge me, for some of them probably dying out of embarrassment at someone potentially laughing at them if they wore a more serious mask, similar to how I would feel sad for someone who got syphilis because they were too embarrassed to ask for a condom, or died of snake bite on their butt because they were too embarrassed to take off their pants to show the doctor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For instance, if I’m walking around outside (pretty safe) and could wear a really safe P100 mask or a less safe cloth mask, and they are about as comfortable to me, and I’m going to end up wearing the P100 when I get to the place I’m going, then it is clearly better to wear the P100 now, except that I do feel kind of silly if I wear the P100 mask walking around outside. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shopfronts where you can go and someone else figures out what you want.&lt;/strong&gt; And you aren’t expected to be friendly or coherent about it. Like, if you are shopping, and yet not having fun, you go there and they figure out that you are the wrong temperature, don’t have enough blood sugar, are taking too serious an attitude to shopping, need ten minutes away from your companions, and should probably buy a pencil skirt. So they get you a smoothie and some comedy and a quiet place to sit down by yourself for a bit, and then send you off to the correct store.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ubiquitous virtual queues.&lt;/strong&gt; Each person’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2014/08/20/imaginary-queues/&quot;&gt;phone keeps&lt;/a&gt; track of their priority waiting, so they don’t have to keep track of it with the location of their body.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficient plane disembarkment.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2016/07/01/aisle-seat-theorizing/&quot;&gt;Like this&lt;/a&gt;. Saving many hours per lifetime of thinking about how planes could be disembarked more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interactive textbook-exam hybrids&lt;/strong&gt; to learn all subjects, on the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A social-antisocial switch in the Uber app.&lt;/strong&gt; Not that ‘social’ would get used much, realistically, but it would be nice to have the option, so that there was common knowledge that it wasn’t being taken, negotiated in an entirely comfortable fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Readily available basic evaluations of things that come up a lot.&lt;/strong&gt; For instance, how much is going to the dentist twice per year instead of once per year worth? How much illness is avoided by the average person washing their hands before eating? How good is getting 8h of sleep instead of 7h? How much extra life do you get for one hour of exercise? How much better is it to trim your hair every three months instead of every year, in terms of time lost disentangling it and appearance? How many uses does an article of clothing usually get? How many fewer if you put it in the dryer even though you are not meant to? I think people mostly just think of dental care and hygiene and sleep and exercise and hair cuts and following proper laundry directions as qualitatively virtuous, and have basically no idea whether they should be willing to drive an hour to go the dentist. Some such evaluations exist, but you have to take initiative and look for them, or usually do some more complicated research putting things together. I’d like it if there were serious research effort on this kind of thing (as if making informed personal decisions were important, rather than an occasional amusement for nerds). And communication such that many figures were floating around and hard to avoid knowing, like it is hard to avoid knowing roughly how many people live in China or having an intuition for how large a ‘large’ drink is relative to a ‘small’ drink.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Readily available probability estimates for things that come up a lot.&lt;/strong&gt; For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/11/17/octobillionupling-effort.html&quot;&gt;how likely are you to spread a cold to someone else&lt;/a&gt; under different policies? How likely are you to broadly endorse your children’s life choices? &lt;a href=&quot;https://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2010/08/24/why-is-medical-advice-all-caution-and-no-info/&quot;&gt;How likely&lt;/a&gt; are cancer, HPV, death, nothing much, if you have a bad pap smear? What are the probabilities of various bad outcomes if you take a drug? This is much like #6. I think we should know roughly how much common things are worth, and how often events of interest happen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A way to type on your phone (and ideally receive information back) inconspicuously without taking it out of your pocket.&lt;/strong&gt; For instance, input using volume button morse code, output using mild vibration. I asked about this on Facebook, and I think the closest suggestions were a &lt;a href=&quot;http://twiddler.tekgear.com/&quot;&gt;one-handed keyboard&lt;/a&gt; that you hold in your hand (but then you need to have an extra object with you always) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.morsecode.translator.jinh&quot;&gt;this morse code app&lt;/a&gt;, which you can at least open and then type with volume buttons and so don’t need to look, though I expect you can’t really use it in your pocket because there are too many parts of the screen you can touch and cause non-morse-code things to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheap places to sleep for 1-12h at any time&lt;/strong&gt; in a dark, quiet, person-sized box. For use in traveling cheaply, napping without going home, or using as an alternative to home if the neighbors are having a party or if their lawn-mowing schedule doesn’t fit with your sleep schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shopfronts where you can go with a group of people to have unusual experiences.&lt;/strong&gt; For instance, you show up with three friends and pay at the door. You are guided into an antechamber where you change into finely embroidered robes and masks with wide tinted lenses that make your eyes look surprised and the world look red. You enter through a narrow archway into a wide, tall room full of streaming (red) sunlight and chanting and a smell that slightly burns your nose. The air is warm and moist, occasionally cut by cool breezes. About thirty other figures are standing around the edges, talking among themselves or chanting with the room. The center of the room is a wide pool of shallow red water over intricate red and white stone. Sometimes a group walks slowly to the center of the pool, and climbs onto a dry, raised platform of black metal. Then the room goes quiet and the group cries out a single cryptic phrase, like ‘blackened backend bulkhead’ and ‘numbed named numbers’. Then some rushed and elaborate displacement of people occurs. One of your friends is displaced by short woman with dark red eyes. She seems to want your group to go to the stage, but all of her words are in the same cryptic assonant triads. “waiting weighting wanting” … “speakers, seekers, peekers”…“annunciate, announce, nuance”… There are white labradors everywhere, but they look pink. You decide to follow her…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

Most basically, how to go about life without catching a deadly or crippling disease. But also, how to make alternative activities workable, and how to thrive and be happy in this potentially oppressive circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With everyone thinking about what to do about similar problems, an interesting set of questions to me is where do ideas for ways to improve the situation come from, and how do they spread? That is, how do people learn about them? &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/11/17/octobillionupling-effort.html&quot;&gt;How much are people benefitting from other people’s thinking&lt;/a&gt; about similar problems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been extremely lucky in having a job that can continue fine from my house, living with a bunch of people I like who can also work from home, having started dating someone I already lived with in January, being in San Francisco, and having some spare money this year, so I’m not compelled to do anything very risky and thus my exact problems and solutions may differ from others’. Nonetheless, it seems good to share them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are pieces of my own current apparatus for avoiding covid and enjoying life despite it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it reached me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microcovid.org/&quot;&gt;microcovid.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;estimating covid risk of activities&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;One of my friends helped make it&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Agreement with my housemates to accrue less than 15 minutes of expected covid harms to the house each day, with spreadsheets calculating the expected harm from covid and documenting our potentially risky behaviors and estimating their costs, based on the downloadable microcovid.org &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microcovid.org/spreadsheet&quot;&gt;spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;for negotiating risks with people I live with&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;we made it (a lot of what we made initially was similar to microcovid.org but less thorough and worse to use, so we replaced it with their spreadsheet.)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://instacart.com/&quot;&gt;Instacart&lt;/a&gt; etc&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;safe groceries&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I already used it a lot of the time&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;for doing things that aren’t very risky, like going for walks outside with a low-risk colleague or alone.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I somewhere got the impression that they were better than the cloth masks that I used to use&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/10/22/P100-PSA.html&quot;&gt;P100 masks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;being potentially very safe from covid at the expense of being a bit uncomfortable after several hours and being a bit less audible (e.g. important indoor medical appointments, flying)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I somehow vaguely knew about them and so in ignorance of anything bought one in March as soon as things looked potentially bad and before they had become scarce on Amazon&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;The impression that touching things isn’t that bad&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;allowing me to be less cautious there (though I still use hand sanitizer)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;people around me reason about this a bit, and public authorities say things about it [ETA: but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/11/01/2020.10.27.20220905.full.pdf&quot;&gt;maybe it is much worse&lt;/a&gt;—yet to investigate]&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Hand sanitizer with more than 70% alcohol&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;cleaning hands out and about&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;suggested by housemate probably, and I forgot what the actual relevant % was meant to be&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Alcohol spray, preferable of a drinkable variety&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;cleaning groceries (we did this at the start, then judged that it was not risky enough to be worth it)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;housemate suggested it&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;reducing risk at expense of some difficulty seeing (usually worn with P100)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;suggested by Facebook friend, then confirmed later by other friends&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gather.town/&quot;&gt;Gather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;virtual events that can have lots of small group conversations instead of one giant awkward one like Zoom&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;a friend invited me to one probably&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Delivery restaurants&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;low effort relatively covid-safe food&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;my household calculated the risk in a very hand-wavey fashion, though this is out of date. Also, we hear other people do this, including in China.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;At home tests, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pixel.labcorp.com/&quot;&gt;Pixel&lt;/a&gt; (others listed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodrx.com/blog/coronavirus-at-home-tests/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;checking if I have covid at home for free, with about three days of delay or two if I bought a test in advance&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;a housemate told me about these and I investigated online&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Quarantine area&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;place to leave packages before bringing them into the house, to let some virus die off and reduce risk&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;in March we assumed the worst about everything as a first pass, then had to do research on virus longevity to feel comfortable letting packages in at all, and found papers on it; we shortened it to one day probably based partly on the impression that other people we knew were being less cautious, and partly on guesses and calculations.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Copper tape&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;killing covid faster on high-touch surfaces&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;was rumored in my online social circles to be somewhat helpful early on, so we put some around; haven’t heard update on whether it is actually helpful&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Disinfection in the oven (200 degrees F for 15 minutes)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;disinfecting delivery food if we are concerned about it&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;employee and maybe housemates knew about this method, and figured out relevant temperatures&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Virtual coffee&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;catching up with colleagues casually&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;my employees and I came up with this early in the year, so that we would feel like we were at work more and have ‘water cooler’ type conversations rather than just meetings.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cires.colorado.edu/news/covid-19-airborne-transmission-tool-available&quot;&gt;CIRES airborne transmission tool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I haven’t used it but might investigate if I needed to do some more serious airborne transmission evaluation e.g. wanted to know if it was safe to repeatedly spend time in some large but ventilated space&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;read about it online somehow&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Air purifiers&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;reducing covid risk, I haven’t had reason to use much, though glad of dentist having one&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;colleague probably&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of these I got from people I know personally. Does everyone have the same list at this point, which spread through acquaintances? Or does everyone have a different list, based on who their acquaintances are? Do my acquaintances drastically overrepresent the kinds of nerds who read lots of papers and make spreadsheets at the slightest nudging and who were already worrying about global catastrophes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m especially curious to hear what is on your list and not mine.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Katja Grace</name></author><category term="covid" /><category term="advice" /><summary type="html">With covid-19, basically everyone in the world is facing a set of personal problems that they didn’t have before, but which have much in common with everyone else’s new problems. Most basically, how to go about life without catching a deadly or crippling disease. But also, how to make alternative activities workable, and how to thrive and be happy in this potentially oppressive circumstance.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/p100downtown.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/p100downtown.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">What is it like to be a tidy person?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/11/18/what-is-it-like-to-be-tidy.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What is it like to be a tidy person?" /><published>2020-11-18T10:58:34-08:00</published><updated>2020-11-18T10:58:34-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/11/18/what-is-it-like-to-be-tidy</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/11/18/what-is-it-like-to-be-tidy.html">&lt;p&gt;A thing I have been curious about since I was about fourteen is why my living quarters are so much messier than other people’s. At that point it was mostly not my own fault, and now that it is, they are less messy. But still, there’s a clear gap between my room and many other people’s rooms that I see. Like for me, if you can see the places where the floor and the walls meet, or if there is a clear path between the door and at least one reasonable place to be in a room, these are victories (bonus points if you don’t have to do any unusual jumping or balancing to follow the path). And other people have entire twelve-foot cubes full of immaculately placed objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might seem like a silly thing to wonder about. For one thing, isn’t it because I don’t choose to clean up my room, whereas they do? Or if not entirely that, isn’t it just that people vary, and I have the trait ‘messy’?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t very satisfying, because what does this difference looks like at a lower level? What is it like to be a tidy person? It’s not just about liking neatness I think. I love neatness. I fantasize every day about cleaning up my room, but then run out of time. It’s quite messy, so would be a lot of hassle to clean up, and I have a lot of things going on. Sometimes if I’m particularly on top of everything, I’ll substantially clean it up, but then as soon as I’m more overwhelmed with other things, I’ll let it slide again, and it will rapidly slide quite far. Kind of like other unsustainable virtuous lifestyle choices, like getting up extra early to read poetry before breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe tidy people just &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; love tidiness, even more than I do? Or maybe they enjoy tidying, like I enjoy reading a little bit before bed, and somehow make time for it? Or do they just prioritize it even higher, like I prioritize work? Or do they have twice as much time or energy as me every day? Does messiness seem like an unconscionable sin, so that they wouldn’t dream of leaving an empty plate on their chest of drawers in the first place, even if they were in the middle of something? Would they never get home and toss a bag of stuff from an event in the corner rather than immediately unpacking it? Do they have fewer objects? (Yes, but I don’t think that explains it—for instance, I also manage to be a constant mild force for messiness in my boyfriend’s room. I suppose it could be about objects:storage ratio, but it doesn’t seem like it.) Does it somehow require less effort for tidy people to make things tidy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have thoughts, but first I’m curious to hear if any tidy people have insight.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Katja Grace</name></author><category term="non-universal-human-experience" /><category term="questions" /><summary type="html">A thing I have been curious about since I was about fourteen is why my living quarters are so much messier than other people’s.

&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty contrived circumstance, and I usually hear Schelling points talked of as if they are neat but only relevant in those rare cases when communication is impossible. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)&quot;&gt;Wikipedia says&lt;/a&gt; ‘In game theory, a focal point (or Schelling point) is a solution that people tend to choose by default in the absence of communication.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was falling asleep last night, somewhere after imagining a kind of house made from genetically engineered trees that just grew into pleasing rounded house shapes roofed with massive leaves, it occurred to me that actually Schelling points are perfectly applicable and even very interesting in cases with communication. It’s just that when there is some combination of a relatively small amount of communication and clear norms about how to respond to communication, then communication often provides a particularly salient Schelling point, so there is not much of a question of what to do, and Schelling points don’t seem relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When many things are being said, or there are other salient Schelling points, or it isn’t clear that everyone’s motives are trustworthy, or probably in other cases, there is no longer a determinate Schelling point necessarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ten thousand oppressed people have to decide when to launch a revolution against a tyrant. If a small number try to revolt alone, they are probably captured by the oppressors and useless to the revolution. So all ten thousand would like to coordinate to fight at once. They can communicate perfectly freely with one another. However there are constantly suggestions that it happen tonight from the youngest and least strategic members of the group, so if such a suggestion is made, everyone has to guess whether this is the one that everyone is going to get behind. Even if Alice is wise and makes such a suggestion, and Bob knows her to be wise, if Bob doesn’t think everyone will be sure enough that everyone will be sure enough, then he won’t want to go out tonight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Charles and Dick are in a fight, and both would strongly like to not be in a fight, however would not like to stop fighting before their opponent, because then they might get punched extra. They also don’t really want to fight beyond when their opponent is fighting, because if they punch him extra, he will hold a grudge. So ideally they would stop at the same time. But there is another Nash equilibrium at both continuing to fight (i.e. if both were going to fight more, neither would want to stop earlier). So they have to try to coordinate on one of the Nash equilibria. Charles says that he is going to stop now, but that doesn’t inform Dick much, because of course Charles wants Dick to think Charles is stopping, since then he too will stop. But Charles always wants Dick to stop sooner, regardless of his own plans. So the communication is hopeless in normal terms, and at least not automatically a Schelling point.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Here is the table of payoffs for one punch:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;stop&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;punch&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;stop&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;5, 5&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;-5, 3&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;punch&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;3, -5&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;4, 4&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ellen and Frederick are meeting in New York City, and their phones are working fine, and Ellen texts ‘I’ll meet you outside the station in ten?’ and Fred texts ‘yeah’. But Ellen is somewhat tempted to go in and wait under the clock because she and Fred met there once before under highly romantic circumstances, and she is interested in going back there, as it were, but from their current platonic situation, it would be weird to just ask him to meet under the clock again, or to immediately proposition him. She figures that if he feels the same way, and their coordination game is on point, he will actually wait for her under the clock, then come outside if she doesn’t show up. And if he’s not there, well, she tried, and will be a minute late outside. Frederick also figures he might be able to risk-free learn if she feels the same way, and waits inside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might argue that these are not all ‘communication’ in some strict sense of genuine information in fact being cheap to convey. Fair enough probably, but in that strict sense, limits to communication are more common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might argue that these are still all very contrived examples. Which is fair, but I suspect it stems at least partly from how hard it is to come up with examples, especially if they are examples of a game theoretic situation you recently thought of being manifest.&lt;/p&gt;

Even if there isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer, you might think it would be massively more efficient to do a good job of answering once with some free variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, my impression is that even before covid, basically everyone was sometimes possibly a bit sick and had to decide whether to go to an event, given that they might be contagious. The usual thing to do, I think, was to consider the question for a bit yourself (or not, depending on conscientiousness), and to maybe mention it to the host and try to guess how annoyed the other guests would be, and then to make a call. But this isn’t a highly personal question—if someone who knew more about infectious disease contagion than most people (which wouldn’t be hard) made a form to tell you what to do based on your symptoms and the number of people at the event, you would probably already be making a better choice, faster, than most people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why doesn’t this happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some answers I can think of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would be great, but it isn’t anyone’s job, and it’s hard to profit from it because hardly anyone will give you a cent for making their judgment for them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would be more effort to open the calculator than the thought most people put into this. (Relatedly, all apparent examples of this are just ‘how worried should I be about X’ where X is something that actually nobody is worried about unless they have an anxiety disorder. There is a form for solving this and it is called a psychiatry intake form.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If someone made such a thing, there is no way that more than a minuscule fraction of the world would come to know about it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Such things exist all over the place, and everyone else is using them and have just never mentioned them to me&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Such things really do involve a lot of personal information somehow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Few people would trust such a tool enough to do what it said&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This sort of thing just isn’t a thing, and people mostly do things that are things. The market isn’t efficient. Everyone’s personal lives are currently like pre-Moneyball baseball.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nobody knows the answers to these questions. It’s possible to have a better answer than most people’s made up ones (e.g. by averaging most people’s made up answers, or having an expert make something up), but nobody wants to either stand behind that, or pay for it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This case is a mysterious anomaly, but there aren’t many such cases. For instance, can you think of more good ones right now? No.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figuring out the covid risk of different activities is another example of massive potential replication of effort, though in that case &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microcovid.org/&quot;&gt;microcovid.org&lt;/a&gt; (and perhaps others) stepped up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a similar feeling at a smaller scale about speculating about the future of AI, which is perhaps why I run &lt;a href=&quot;http://aiimpacts.org/&quot;&gt;aiimpacts.org&lt;/a&gt; and other people don’t. (While that enlightens me on some specific things that might go wrong with trying to do this, it’s hard for a particular project to shed light on the problems with a category it is in, since it is in many categories and presumably might have problems from all of them.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;when a period intended for something ends, and you haven’t finished it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when a period for starting something occurs, and you haven’t finished the last thing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when a period for something occurs and you really don’t feel like it relative to something else that is perfectly productive, but not the intended activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If it’s ‘bed time’, but you are making a lot of progress on writing, should you go to bed?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you mean to stop work and go outside at 5pm, and now it is 5pm and you are in the middle of something that will be annoying to get back to, do you stop and go outside?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you meant to set aside 3h on Sunday for working on some self-improvement things, and it is now an hour into that period because you woke up late, and also you haven’t finished figuring out what you need to do today at all, should you move immediately to the planned time block or finish planning your day and getting up?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you meant to write in your planner every morning before work, and it is work time and you haven’t done it, should you start work fifteen minutes late?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the answer is ‘it depends’: there are some circumstances where you should stick with what you are doing or excited about, and others you should stick to the plan. But I wonder how far to lean one way or the other, or what it should depend on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think in practice it is a thing I make many judgments about without a lot of thought, and without remembering or learning from the huge number of other such judgments I’ve made.
