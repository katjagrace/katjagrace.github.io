    <p>It is said that we share <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-does-the-fact-that-w/">99.9%</a> of our genes with one another, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-does-the-fact-that-w/">95%</a> with chimpanzees, and <a href="https://www.breakthroughs.com/foundations-science/how-genetically-related-are-we-bananas">60%</a> with bananas. (It is also <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/genetic/people-bananas-share-dna.htm">said</a> that this isn’t quite right about bananas, but reading about that did not quell my confusion.)</p>

<p>It is further said that I share 50% of my genes with my brother, and that this is why I like him.</p>

<p>And yet, I seem to be more closely related to my brother than to a banana.</p>

<p>A natural way to resolve this incongruity is to suppose that my brother and I share 50% of the 0.01% of genes that might possibly vary between two humans, which we call ‘50% of my genes’ as a shorthand.</p>

<p>But this raises a problem. The usual explanation for familial affection evolving is that since my brother shares half of my genes, from a genetic perspective it is half-selfish for me to look after his welfare. So genes that make me care about my brother tend to spread.</p>

<p>But on this new model where ‘50%’ is shorthand for ‘50% of the way between virtually all and all’, taking care of my brother is about as good as taking care of myself (genetically). And a banana is worthy of my kin affection more than I thought my brother was. All living creatures are my family, and all humankind is myself.</p>

<p>This does not describe my feelings about bananas, and to learn of a basic biological drive for selflessness across vast swathes of the tree of life would be a bit of a surprise.</p>

<p>How does this actually work?</p>
