    <p>It felt strange going into this US election so hopeful for Biden to win while so at a loss regarding why comparably many Americans were badly hoping for the opposite. I heard people <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/224-key-trumps-appeal/">speculating</a> about the possible motives, and I considered plausible steelmen. But why should I be guessing about what half of people think? I <a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/11/05/election-survey.html">figured out</a> how to survey some Americans beyond my vicinity.<!--ex--></p>

<p>I surveyed about 63 people, asking them:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Who did you vote for in the US presidential election 2020?</li>
  <li>What was the reasoning behind your choice?</li>
  <li>What would be the worst thing about your least favorite candidate winning?</li>
  <li>Who do you think is going to win?</li>
  <li>What went through your head when Trump said that he had won the election already on Tuesday night?</li>
</ul>

<p>20 out of 63 preferred Trump (19 voted plus one would have chosen Trump if forced to vote). Here is the reasoning they gave for their choices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HE SUPPORTS FOR WELFARE</li>
  <li>spite</li>
  <li>I want a better America!</li>
  <li>I like the presidency over the lead of the Donald Trump.</li>
  <li>THE SOCIETY VERY CAREFUL PERSON OF THE ELECTION VOTE TRUMP AND VERY GOOD ELECTION</li>
  <li>SUPPORTING THE WELFARE</li>
  <li>the only of good electionship of a best moment</li>
  <li>He has been a good ;leader delivering on all his promises.</li>
  <li>I’m a republican and i just have to vote for trump because he represents the republican party even though he’s not smart.</li>
  <li>IT IS MY OPINION</li>
  <li>he was an trusted person and good one</li>
  <li>I believe in what Donald Trump stands for. I cannot vote Democrat because I am a Christian who is Pro-Life.</li>
  <li>He is the most qualified to lead the country, regardless of his character that many hate.</li>
  <li>I support his America First agenda</li>
  <li>I feel he is the better choice to lead us</li>
  <li>Supreme court, guns, political correctness.</li>
  <li>With the economy precociousending radical race theory, creating peace in the middle east, and working with Americans so that we are treated fairly locally and globally, I believe he deserves a second term to continue his work.</li>
  <li>Trump is saving america from the chi com globalists.</li>
  <li>Trump has done some good things for the economy. I also believe he has strengthened our national security.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is what would go badly if Trump loses, according to these respondents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HE OPPOSES</li>
  <li>fraud against the American electorate</li>
  <li>unsure</li>
  <li>Choosing the right ecommerce platform for the business digital presence is critical. Also to find the one that meets the needs.</li>
  <li>TRUMP WINNING</li>
  <li>HE OPPOSE</li>
  <li>He’s not likely to win in South Carolina it is the good election</li>
  <li>The country will be destroyed.</li>
  <li>The Democratic candidate would probably increase the tax on the rich which i think is not fair.</li>
  <li>I DONT KNOW</li>
  <li>they will not interact with people directly</li>
  <li>Turning this country into a socialist country.</li>
  <li>A rebellion may start in the country.</li>
  <li>Massive increase of illegal immigration</li>
  <li>The direction he will take our country</li>
  <li>Political correctness winning, them thinking that since they won, they can go to even more extremes.</li>
  <li>More wars, corruption in government, and media suppression on conservative thoughts.</li>
  <li>China becomes the world super power.</li>
  <li>I believe Joe Biden’s policies would move America away from nationalism and toward socialism.</li>
</ul>

<p>What to make of that?</p>

<p>I noted yesterday that <a href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/11/05/election-survey.html">everyone thinks their candidate will win</a></p>

<p>Another notable thing is that a large number of responses are hard to make sense of. A friend suggested many are bots, but none of the apparent Biden-leaning responses are like this, and would bots always claim to vote Trump? (Also, aren’t bots good at writing now?)</p>

<p>Here are a few arbitrarily chosen answers to the reasoning question from Biden supporters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I am a democrat, and I love their policies</li>
  <li>I felt we need a traditional U.S president. I also felt he might bring some stability to the U.S.</li>
  <li>Trump is the worse leader in US history. We need a strong leader now that unites us and helps us move forward rather than creating division.</li>
  <li>Biden is a Democrat.</li>
  <li>I am a democrat. But more importantly, I am so sick of Trump’s lies, manipulation, and general hateful divisive attitude. We need to get the country together and reassert ourselves as a respectable nation.</li>
  <li>Joe Biden’s policies actually aim to help Americans as well as protecting the environment while Trump is a pseudo dictator who’s broken countless laws and continues to do so, on top of being a racist, misogynistic, terrible person.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m3c13EOE2nlqQVU-1Ekilcz-wxxZVrUEe8Jm7qjsjLo/edit?usp=sharing">Here</a> is all of the data.</p>

<p>Here’s my summary of the issues that Biden and Trump supporters care about, by number of mentions [ETA: including all that at least two people cared about]:</p>

<p><img src="https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/i/katjasgrace/issues.png" alt="voter issues" /></p>

<p>(There are really about half as many Trump supporters as Biden supporters, but they are under-represented in the graph because I was less able to make out particular issues in what they wrote, whereas Biden supporters often mentioned multiple issues.)</p>
