<p><span style="color:grey"><em>Oh yeah. Alright then.</em></span></p>

<p>Pastoral <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>When I was younger<br />
it was plain to me<br />
I must make something of myself.<br />
Older now<br />
I walk the back streets<br />
admiring the houses<br />
of the very poor:<br />
roof out of line with sides<br />
the yards cluttered<br />
with old chicken wire, ashes,<br />
furniture gone wrong;<br />
the fences and outhouses<br />
built of barrel-staves<br />
and parts of boxes, all,<br />
if I am fortunate,<br />
smeared a bluish green<br />
that properly weathered<br />
pleases me best
of all colors.</p>

<p>No one<br />
will believe this<br />
of vast import to the nation.</p>

<p>…Hmm</p>

<p>I suppose it is something to do with honoring the poor, —</p>

<p><span style="color:grey"><em>Nah-— sorry, go on.</em></span></p>

<p>Hmm?</p>

<p><span style="color:grey"><em>You first!</em></span></p>

<p>Well, when he was young, he thought that making something of himself—being rich and successful—was where it was at. But now here he is among the vast detail of the poor, and he realizes that the world is big, and this is important.</p>

<p><span style="color:grey"><em>Hmm. I disagree.</em></span></p>

<p>Ok, go ahead.</p>

<p><span style="color:grey"><em>He’s saying that he used to be a young rationalist, and he intended to do what was maximally good with his life, because it was logically impossible and therefore literally unimaginable that anything could be better than that. And then he grew up and found himself standing among these chicken wires and rubble and it’s transcendently beautiful, and he’s like ‘man, I really needed to <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/21/universal-love-said-the-cactus-person/">get out of the car</a>’.</em></span></p>

<p>So, he learned that these mundane things were beautiful?</p>

<p><span style="color:grey"><em>No, not beauty traditionally understood. More the kind of transcendent beauty that everything arguably has. He’s found a new kind of thing rather than having clearly learned anything in his previous sense of learning things or found anything nice to look at in his previous sense. What has overall happened and how these things relate to each other, he struggles to put into words, but he also finds that his previous devotion to putting things into words has waned anyway, and not having words no longer feels like unconsciousness..</em></span></p>

<p>Oh, I see—-he was a young rationalist, and then he listened to Hamilton the Musical. Your account doesn’t make sense of the end though: “No one … will believe this … of vast import to the nation.”</p>

<p><span style="color:grey"><em>I can’t even parse it. No one will believe this, which is of vast import to the nation?</em></span></p>

<p>No, I think, ‘no one will believe that this is of vast import to the nation’</p>

<p><span style="color:grey"><em>Ah-then it makes sense: this new thing is of vast import to the nation, but no-one will believe that.</em></span></p>

<p>Seems like a stretch that it is of vast import to the nation.</p>

<p><span style="color:grey"><em>Well if it is vastly important-and it seems to be, because it has transformed his world-then it is probably also vastly important on a national scale. Like, the nation and the transcendent beauty are probably not in separate magisteria.</em></span></p>

<p>Ah. I like your interpretation. It might even be right.</p>

<p><span style="color:grey"><em>It would be nice to be able to contact the author and check. Is he dead?</em></span></p>

<p>I think so. Maybe the internet can tell us something.</p>

<p><span style="color:grey"><em>I don’t know, they might just read into it something about whatever they have going on.</em></span></p>
