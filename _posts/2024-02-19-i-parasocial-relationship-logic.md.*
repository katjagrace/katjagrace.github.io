summary: What will happen to everything I like?

If:

1. You become like the five people you spend the most time with (or something remotely like that)

2. The people who are most extremal in good ways tend to be highly successful

Should you try to have 2-3 of your five relationships be parasocial ones with people too successful to be your friend individually?
