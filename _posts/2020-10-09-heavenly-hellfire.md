Today I read about ancient history instead of doing work. Which got me thinking about Santorini.

If you see blue-domed chapels with whitewashed walls perched idyllically over the Aegean sea, there is a good chance you've got yourself (a picture of) Santorini.

Such pictures got a new flavor for me when I realized that the wide circular bay these buildings overlook is actually the caldera of a massive volcano. The flavor is similar to the one they would have if the cliffs resolved into the eyelids of a giant looking up beneath the waves.

When I say the volcano is large, I don't mean I know anything about the usual distribution of volcano sizes. Just that I can zoom out on [Google maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Santorini/@36.4072715,25.3504186,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x1499ce86adfd9ff7:0xb2a761f740d68afc!8m2!3d36.3931562!4d25.4615092) almost enough to see the whole of Greece, and still make out the lip of this volcano.

The volcano was responsible for the [Minoan eruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_eruption), [one of the biggest volcanic eruptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_large_volcanic_eruptions) in the last twenty thousand years, and [possibly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_eruption#Minoan_civilization) the downfall of Minoa. It unsurprisingly destroyed the city of [Akrotiri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrotiri_(prehistoric_city)) which is actually on Santorini. Very surprisingly to me, it didn't destroy it that much, such that it is an exciting archeological site (note that I have no expertise, and am going only by my evidently wrong imagination for what happens if melted rock comes out of a hole that big with enough force to go anywhere). Also surprisingly to me, [it seems](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrotiri_(prehistoric_city)#Excavations>) to have been successfully evacuated, with practically nobody killed in the blast.

If you asked me to predict how well I would do living on the island rim of an underwater volcano sixteen hundred years before the birth of Christ, on the unlucky occasion of it erupting intensely, I would have guessed 'very badly'. Apparently the buildings of Akrotiri were often several stories high and some had indoor water-flushing toilets though, so it seems they had their shit together much more than I would have expected.
