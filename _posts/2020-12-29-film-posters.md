Sometimes I like to think of desires as like film posters. You come across them, and they urge you to do something, and present it in a certain way, and induce some inclination to do it. But film posters are totally different from films. If you like a film poster, you don't have to try to see the film. There is no metaphysical connection between the beauty of a film poster and the correctness of you seeing the film. It's some evidence, but you have other evidence, and you get to choose. A film poster can be genuinely the most beautiful film poster you've ever seen, without the film being a worthwhile use of two hours. That's largely an orthogonal question. If you put up the poster on your wall and look at it lovingly every day, and never see the film, that doesn't need to be disappointing&mdash;it might be the best choice, and you might be satisfied in choosing it.
