summary: Will either be deep in a thousand years?

People seem to find suffering deep. Serious writings explore the experiences of all manner of misfortunes, and the nuances of trauma and torment involved. Itâ€™s hard to write an essay about a really good holiday that seems as profound as an essay about a really unjust abuse. A dark past can be plumbed for all manner of meaning, whereas a slew of happy years is boring and empty, unless perhaps they are *too* happy and suggest something dark below the surface. (More thoughts in the vicinity of this [here](https://worldspiritsockpuppet.substack.com/p/home-up-and-down-colder-and-warmer-20-02-20).)

I wonder if one day suffering will be so avoidable that the myriad hurts of present-day existence will seem to future people like the problem of excrement getting on everything. Presumably a real issue in 1100 AD, but now irrelevant, unrelatable, decidedly not fascinating or in need of deep analysis.<!--ex-->
