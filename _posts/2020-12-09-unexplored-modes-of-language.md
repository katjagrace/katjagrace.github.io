English can be communicated via 2D symbols that can be drawn on paper using a hand and seen with eyes, or via sounds that can be made with a mouth and heard by ears.

These two forms are the same language because the mouth sounds and drawn symbols correspond at the level of words (and usually as far as sounds and letters, at least substantially). That is, if I write 'ambition', there is a specific mouth sound that you would use if converting it to spoken English, whereas if you were converting it to spoken French, there might not be a natural equivalent.

As far as I know, most popular languages are like this: they have a mouth-sound version and a hand-drawn (or hand-typed) version. They often have a braille version, with symbols that can be felt by touch instead of vision. An exception is sign languages (which are generally not just alternate versions of spoken languages), which use 4-D symbols gestured by hands over time, and received by eyes.

I wonder whether there are more modes of languages that it would be good to have. Would we have them, if there were? It's not clear from [a brief perusal of Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_sign_language) that Europe had sophisticated sign languages prior to about five hundred years ago. Communication methods generally have strong network effects&mdash;it's not worth communicating by some method that nobody can understand, just like it's not worth joining an empty dating site&mdash;and new physical modes of English are much more expensive than for instance new messaging platforms, and have nobody to promote them.

Uncommon modes of language that seem potentially good (an uninformed brainstorm):
- **symbols drawn with hands on skin, received by touch**, I've heard of blind and deaf people such as Helen Keller using this, but it seems useful for instance when it is loud, or when you don't want to be overheard or to annoy people nearby, or for covert communication under the table at a larger event, or for when you are wearing a giant face mask.
-**symbols gestured with whole body** like interpretive dance, but with objective interpretation. Good from a distance, when loud, etc. Perhaps conducive to different sorts of expressiveness, like how verbal communication makes singing with lyrics possible, and there is complementarity between the words and the music.
- **symbols gestured with whole body, interpreted by computer, received as written text** What if keyboards were like a Kinect dance game? Instead of using your treadmill desk while you type with your hands, you just type with your arms, legs and body in a virtual reality whole-body keyboard space. Mostly good for exercise, non-sedentariness, feeling alive, etc.
- **drumming/tapping, received by ears or touch** possibly faster than spoken language, because precise sounds can be very fast. I don't know. This doesn't really sound good.
- **a sign version of English** this [exists, but is rare](https://www.verywellhealth.com/signing-exact-english-and-syntax-1046860). Good for when it is loud, when you don't want to be overheard, when you are wearing a giant face mask or are opposed to exhaling too much on the other person, when you are at a distance, etc.
- **symbols drawn with hands in one place** e.g. the surface of a phone, or a small number of phone buttons, such that you could enter stuff on your phone by tapping your fingers in place in a comfortable position with the hand you were holding it with, preferably still in your pocket, rather than awkwardly moving them around on the surface while you hold it either with another hand or some non-moving parts of the same hand, and having to look at the screen while you do it. This could be combined with the first one on this list.
- **What else?**

Maybe if there's a really good one, we could overcome the network effect with an assurance contract. (Or try to, and learn more about why assurance contracts aren't used more.)
