summary: A nice way to count things in the non-virtual world

My [points for anxiety](https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/12/01/points-for-anxiety.html) system continued to help, but was encumbered by the friction of getting my phone out to mark points. Thus I have turned to wearable abaci.

I made this necklace according to very roughly [this picture](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/212724782374260653/), using knitting wool and beads I bought at one point to use as virtual in-house currency and now found in a box in my room. It works well! The beads don't shift unless I move them, which is easy and pleasing. It seems clearly more convenient than my phone. (Plus, I can show off to those in the know that I have 4 or 6 or 24 or 26 of something!) I am alsoÂ for now reminded when I look in a mirror to consider whether I can get a point, which is currently a plus.<!--ex-->

You can buy bracelet versions in a very small number of places online, and also keychain or general hanging clip-on versions, but I don't think I saw necklaces anywhere. This seems striking, given the clear superiority to a phone counter for me so far, and the likely scale of phone counter usage in the world.
