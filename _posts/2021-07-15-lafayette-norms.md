Seeking to cross a road on the walk into downtown Lafayette, instead of the normal pedestrian crossing situation, we met a button with a sign, 'Push button to turn on warning lights'. I wondered, if I pressed it, would it then be my turn to cross? Or would there just be some warning lights? What was the difference? Do traffic buttons normally do something other than change the lights? I clearly believe they do. They make it my turn. But they don't send a wire into the 'whose turn is it' variable deep in the ought-sphere, so what exactly do they do?

I suspected that this button didn't change whose turn it was, and it felt empty and devoid of some special potence of being a traffic button.

I liked to imagine that it was just a normal traffic button, but taking a more nihilistic view of its role.<!--ex--> In which case, its nihilistic view seemed to have practical consequences! It wasn't being as good a good traffic button while saying that it didn't change whose turn it is. It genuinely fails to coordinate the traffic so well, because here am I unable to garner the 'right' to cross with confidence, and there are the drivers unsure what I'm doing. But shouldn't a traffic button be able to do its job regardless of its philosophical commitments, or without pretending to have philosophical commitments it doesn't have?

One might say that the thing going on is that it being 'my turn' is a fact about everyone's expectations. For instance, if the drivers will expect me to cross, then it is 'my turn'. (I'm tempted to say 'if the drivers think it is my turn, then it is my turn', but what are the drivers then thinking?) This doesn't seem quite right, in that the drivers themselves are asking whether this light means that it is the pedestrian's turn, and all of us seem to be asking something about the underlying truth, not about each other. Also, if I run erratically into the road, the drivers and I may both come to expect that I am going to cross, but it still isn't my turn.

I fantasized that I had woken up in a new world which was just like the old world, but where everything was like the traffic light. I would phone the doctor's office later to ask if it was ok to cancel my appointment this late, they would just say, 'I'll change what it says in this schedule'.

'But is it *ok*?'

‘I will not record your cancellation.’

'Should I pay you?'

'I am not charging you'

'But is that like a favor, or is it the policy? Have I wronged your medical practice? Do I owe you *really*? Tell me if I was bad!'

'I erased your name from this box on my piece of paper.'

My tentative take is that turns are real, and we created them, and traffic buttons have genuine power over them, and if a traffic button doesn't recognize their existence it is potentially at a real disadvantage, perhaps in a similar way to how a chair maker who doesn't recognize chairs as a thing is at a disadvantage.

(To be clear, I expect philosophers have much better thought out views on this, and welcome people telling me what they are--this is me thinking aloud, not philosophical advice.)
