I am sometimes unsure what is meant to be enjoyed in things, for instance the short story [*The Gioconda Smile*](https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2021/01/04/giaconda-smile.html), or *In the mood for love* which [people](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/13/100-best-films-movies-of-the-21st-century) [often](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_considered_the_best) enjoy a lot. Which seems like it shouldn't be a problem, as long as I find something to enjoy in them. But it also seems like I would be seriously missing something if I was buying bags of coffee all these years just to appreciate the thick, substantive quality of the paper bag between my teeth as I chewed it. How many of my enjoyments are like this?
