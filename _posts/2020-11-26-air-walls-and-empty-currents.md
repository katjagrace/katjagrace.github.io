There is an experience archetype in my world that goes like this: you have been carefully navigating around a landscape of walls, or inching forward against an overwhelming current. Intently battling hard obstacles. Then you tentatively try walking right into a wall, and realize that they are all actually just air, and you can just walk straight through them. Or you find a turn of mind where you can just stand up straight against the wrenching current&mdash;not through huge effort and force, but through the current suddenly losing all physical relevance to your free motions.

Is this familiar? What circumstances are like this?
