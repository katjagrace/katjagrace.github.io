I found [Tensorflow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/) pretty cool to play with, in case anyone is looking for the kind of intuitive understanding of neural nets that futzing with a thing with one's hands contributes to.

One game you can play is pretending to be a training algorithm. How would you adjust the weights, if you wanted to classify which of two spirals a point comes from?
