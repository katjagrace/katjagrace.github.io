summary: You can listen to Michael Trazzi and I discuss AI
---

I recently talked to Michael Trazzi for his podcast, The Inside View. It just came out, so if that's a conversation you want to sit in on, do so [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSw3UVDZge0). 


The main topics were the [survey of ML folk](https://aiimpacts.org/what-do-ml-researchers-think-about-ai-in-2022/) I recently ran, and my thoughts on moving more slowly on potentially world-threatening AI research (which is to say, AI research in general, [according to](https://aiimpacts.org/what-do-ml-researchers-think-about-ai-in-2022/) the median surveyed ML researcher...). I also bet him a thousand dollars to his hundred that AI would not make blogging way more efficient in two years, if I recall. (I forget the exact terms, and there's no way I'm listening to myself talk for that long to find out. If anyone else learns, I'm curious what I agreed to.)

For completeness of podcast reporting: I forgot to mention that [I also talked to Daniel Filan on AXRP](https://axrp.net/episode/2021/07/23/episode-10-ais-future-and-dangers-katja-grace.html), like a year ago. In other old news, I am opposed to the vibe of time-sensitivity often implicit in the public conversation.
