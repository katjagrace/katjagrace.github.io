doom scenario that looks like current poverty

When people think about AI destroying the human race, I think they suppose that whatever the scenario is, it's going to be some kind of science-fiction-level-crazy. And thus the whole basket of scenarios is marked down in plausibility, and with them the 'AI risk' problem itself.

I think this is wrong. 

AI disaster could look like very familiar problems, even as the last humans perish. This is a pretty plausible scenarios.

Today in the world, many people are sidelined from the economy. They don't have anything to sell which the world will pay for,

 And so many people take leave to work on something more 'plausible', like the developing world.
