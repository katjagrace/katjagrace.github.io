With the 2020 reduction of variety in places and companionship that might set the days apart, there is a risk of swathes of time blending together and seeming short. One solution is to substitute other sources of visceral variety. Yesterday I had the song [Hellfire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3NoDEu7kpg) from Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame stuck in my head all day, which I can recommend as intense and a different vibe from normal.
