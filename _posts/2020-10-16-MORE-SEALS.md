In case others also wanted to see [more round seals](/_posts/2010-10-15-problems-and-gratitudes), I present several that I came across in my investigation of illustrations for that last post, and a more extended the seal perusal that followed.

On considering the existence of seals more, I came to wonder how this body design—short plump fur snake with weirdly placed flipper limbs, apparently optimized for being extremely cute while lying in one place—could possibly evolve in a world where animal dexterity can get pretty high, e.g. also leopards exist, and there is just no good reason for them to be cute. After minor YouTube investigation, I think a) seals are not somehow surprisingly agile on land; b) seals live in water, where this seems to be an excellent body design; c) penguins and seals are fairly similarly shaped water creatures, but in their awkward land phase, rest on different edges.
