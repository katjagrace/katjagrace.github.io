I have an Anki[^1] deck of things I feel like a failure regarding. Instead of each card having a question that I see if I can remember the answer to, it has a potentially shameful thing that I see if I still feel bad about. Each time I look at one, as well as marking it correct to the extent that I no longer feel bad about it, I briefly do a little bit to make it better. (Learn about the thing I'm embarrassed to not know about, practice the skill that I don't have, think about whether it's a real problem, etc). My sense is that one can often feel bad about something for a long time which one could alternatively make marked progress on in a very short time.

This time I drew a card marked, 'can't critique food'. Admittedly not the most horrifying of failures, and I don't currently feel too bad about it, or remember writing it down. But I suppose that what I had in mind is that when people discuss the merits or subtleties of different foods and food establishments, I often feel like the topic is outside my domain, and furthermore suspect that if my strongest views of the moment were revealed&mdash;e.g. "good fries > bad fries >> not fries", or "I want to eat something cool and wet and I prefer it involve parsley", or "pea protein is the worst"&mdash;I would seem childish.

So I read online briefly and found that Jonathan Gold is a famous food critic, then read a very small amount of [his writing](https://www.eater.com/2018/7/23/17600982/jonathan-gold-best-work-reviews-writing). Now I will have a go at critiquing food at all, which I expect is a decent step toward being passable at it (while also fulfilling my intention to occasionally do things I haven't done).

***On an almost empty teacup of [Mary's Gone crackers](https://www.marysgonecrackers.com/) I found in my bedroom while cleaning up recently.***

*Food that you know has been sitting open on your desk for a week can be tainted by a foul flavor of unease. But my expectations for these crackers were cleansed with the fresh-toasted snap and delicate flavor of my first nibble of one.*

*Crispy things are often light and insubstantial&mdash;crunch and heft seem to often overlap in coarse, unyielding foods. Yet this Mary's Gone cracker had both a pleasing, easy crackle and a real density. And while in no way chewy, it was good to chew: coming apart not into a wheat slurry, but into a textured rubble of seed meal, satisfying and nutty. I wanted to find the fragments lost in the corners of my mouth. I wanted to crush the last seeds with my teeth. All the while the bright taste of toasted herbs lingered, sometimes veering into a burning. Not of chili, but of flavor.*

*Then my boyfriend became available for chatting, and I chatted with him, ceasing to resist the temptation to eat virtually all of the crackers. I bit them thoughtfully as we spoke, knowing I was eating up the opportunity to critique them, but only sparing enough attention from the conversation to favor this end, on grounds that they were presently delicious.*

*In sum, Mary's Gone Crackers are very good crackers, and survive surprisingly well in an uncovered teacup. If you keep a stack of them in a teacup with a somewhat but not much larger diameter, this can also be spatially pleasing.*
