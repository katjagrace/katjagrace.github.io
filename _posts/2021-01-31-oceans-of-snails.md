Somehow while knowing that a) 'sea snail' was a concept, and b) beaches were strewn with sea shells, which involve various snail-reminiscent spirals, I failed to reach the stunning conclusion that the oceans are substantially inhabited by these kinds of characters:

But its true. And it seems that not only are the spiral-looking shells from snails, but various flat and non-spiral ones are too.

This is a meaningful update because snails are a particular kind of thing I'm familiar with, and furthermore I like them.
