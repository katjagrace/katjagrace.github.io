summary: Spencer Greenberg and I discuss living as a bounded and irrational creature
---

I [talked to Spencer Greenberg](https://clearerthinkingpodcast.com/episode/105) a little while ago for his podcast [Clearer Thinking](https://clearerthinkingpodcast.com/). The recording is out today. According to his website we discussed:

>What does it mean to be "groupstruck"? How does groupstruck-ness differ from the bystander effect, normalcy bias, and other related cognitive biases? How do we break people out of being groupstruck? What does it mean to be a "bounded" person? How can we build up better decision-making heuristics? What sorts of decisions do people usually not quantify but should (and vice versa)? How can we make rational relationship decisions without coming across as "calculating" or cold? How does anthropic reasoning affect our hypotheses about the nature of the universe and life within it (i.e., the Fermi paradox, the simulation hypothesis, etc.)?
