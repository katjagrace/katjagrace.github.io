I like to have plants in honor of things I've done. I'm not consistent or proportionate about it, and admittedly I also have quite a few plants that I intend to be in honor of things I haven't yet done. But now that [this blog](http://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/) has apparently functional comments and images and analytics, as well as words on pages on the internet, I declare it fully bloggy, and my [effort to make](https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/10/25/new-blog.html) a blog complete. Here's my blog plant:

I welcome perspectives on good marginal improvements toward WSSP being a pleasing blog to interact with. (I'm aware that the subscription possibilities are not as salient as they could be.) It is a static site made using Jekyll and kept on Github, with its comments looked after by Disqus and its analytics by Google and its pictures by Photobucket.
