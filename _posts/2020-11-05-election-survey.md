Last night I was especially curious about why people vote as they do, and whether they were experiencing the election similarly to me. So I set up a survey in [Positly](https://www.positly.com/) and paid a bunch of people to tell me about such things.

I haven't read all of the responses yet, but a notable feature of them so far is the extent to which people expected their own favorite candidate to win the presidency.  If someone said both who they voted for (or would vote for if forced to vote) and who they thought would win, these were the same person 87% of the time.

Is this just 'wishful thinking' (whatever that is) or some more interesting phenomenon?
