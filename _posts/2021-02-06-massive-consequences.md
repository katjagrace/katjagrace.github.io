Hypothesis: whenever you make a choice, the consequences of it are almost as likely to be bad as good, because the scale of the intended consequences is radically smaller than the scale of the chaotic unintended effects. (The expected outcome is still as positive as you think, it's just a small positive value plus a very high variance random value at each step.)

This seems different from how things are usually conceived, but does it change anything that we don't already know about?

Could this be false?
