Today I put up the last page in [AI Impacts](http://aiimpacts.org/)' (primarily Ronny Fernandez's) [investigation](https://aiimpacts.org/are-human-engineered-flight-designs-better-or-worse-than-natural-ones/) into how human-made flying machines compare to evolved ones. (Relevant to how we expect human efforts to build minds to compare to evolved minds.) Evolution mostly won.

Some other interesting things I learned in the process of editing this:
- Monarch butterflies [can probably fly](https://aiimpacts.org/energy-efficiency-of-monarch-butterfly-flight/) at least 100km on the energy in about a quarter of a raspberry (not counting the energy they get from the wind, which seems to be central to their flying methods. And not to suggest that they eat raspberries, I am just more familiar with those than flower nectar).
- [People](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/z79-180) who estimate monarch butterfly 'performance parameters' sometimes do so by attaching plasticine to dead butterflies to get them to the right weight and balance, and then hand-throwing them across the room and noting measurements for those "in which no obvious pitching up or stalling occurred after release" (or at least they did in 1979).
- [Paramotors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramotor) are a thing. They are like a giant fan you wear on your back to turn your paraglider into a powered vehicle.
- A model airplane [crossed the Atlantic on a gallon of fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Spirit_of_Butts%27_Farm&oldid=918639855) (this was the [furthest per Joule](https://aiimpacts.org/are-human-engineered-flight-designs-better-or-worse-than-natural-ones/) of the machines in our collection).
- This [pedal-powered flying machine](https://www.reddit.com/r/aerospace/comments/1hein1/great_photo_of_the_gossamer_albatross_from_1980/) crossed the English Channel.

  This might be a slightly different one:
