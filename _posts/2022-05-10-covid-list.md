summary: What a non-expert might do if they had covid.
---
In case anyone wants a rough and likely inaccurate guide to what I might do if I had covid to mitigate it, I looked into this a bit recently and wrote notes. It's probably better than if one's plan was to do less than a few hours of research, but is likely flawed all over the place and wasn't written with public sharing in mind, and um, isn't medical advice:

[Here's](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11cF4k9NUltfiEYv8yhsw2Ku8qRITQY5IqxJ71jFpVO4/edit?usp=sharing) a Google doc version, where any comments you leave might be seen by the next person looking (and you might see comments added by others).

[Here's](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10awWMz3DyJi2OibnVlMg-2sipWfZ3jm8P_MyLUbK_ZE/edit?usp=sharing) a much longer doc with the reasoning, citations and more comments.

(I continue to guess that long covid is worth avoiding.)
