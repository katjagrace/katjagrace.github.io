Dear Mama,

Happy Christmas!

Rather than be so bold as to give you a further object to take care of, I gathered for you a collection of things I think you might like on the internet. I CC the world, in case they are interested, or want to add anything.

Lots of love,
Katja

4. [Round seals that I gathered earlier](https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/10/16/MORE-SEALS.html)

5. [Dance your PhD winner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQvJOSCoi4) (though perhaps you showed that to me originally..)

6. [The complete works of Alfred Sisley](https://www.alfredsisley.org/the-complete-works.html)

7. [Archive of Olegas Truchanas' photography](https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-144700220)

8. [The 1890s, around the world, on film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHqha40xRL4&t=131s)

9. [Positly](https://www.positly.com/about/): Perhaps you have enough opportunities to interview people, but if you want to run your own surveys of strangerse online, this streamlines the process a lot (i.e. you basically write some questions and put money in the slot and they handle getting strangers to answer your questions and paying them). For instance, I asked some Americans [why they voted as they did](https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/11/06/why-trump.html), and some other things about their experience of the election.

10. [Hamilton the Musical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPSWZUExZ8M&list=RDaPSWZUExZ8M&start_radio=1&t=4435): I know I probably recommended this before, but a) I should note that it might be the strongest artistic recommendation I've ever given, and b) if you did listen to it, I recommend listening to it again.

11. [How to live for much longer in expectation](https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/cryonics.html) (I know you don't believe in this, but I encourage you to think about it more, because its important to me that you avoid dying if feasible.)

12. [Rijksmuseum](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en): the national museum of the Netherlands has a pleasing website for their pleasing art collection.

  Here are some that I like today:
