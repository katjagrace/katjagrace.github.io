Autumn clothes  
from old websites  
in my drying machine  

&nbsp;

Thin cardboard box  
with pictures of face creams  
now roaming nearby

&nbsp;

Handful of tissues  
collected from drifts  
many tears and lunches  

&nbsp;

Careful library  
of things  
I haven't gotten around to  

&nbsp;

Where would I keep this  
very big pad of paper  
if I were Critch?

&nbsp;

Don't eat the pepparkakor  
just because they are there  
I did and regret nothing

&nbsp;

Moldy washcloth  
my mother gave to me  
I wash it
