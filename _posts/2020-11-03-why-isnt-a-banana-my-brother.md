It is said that we share [99.9%](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-does-the-fact-that-w/) of our genes with one another, [95%](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-does-the-fact-that-w/) with chimpanzees, and [60%](https://www.breakthroughs.com/foundations-science/how-genetically-related-are-we-bananas) with bananas. (It is also [said](https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/genetic/people-bananas-share-dna.htm) that this isn't quite right about bananas, but reading about that did not quell my confusion.)

It is further said that I share 50% of my genes with my brother, and that this is why I like him.

And yet, I seem to be more closely related to my brother than to a banana.

A natural way to resolve this incongruity is to suppose that my brother and I share 50% of the 0.01% of genes that might possibly vary between two humans, which we call '50% of my genes' as a shorthand.

But this raises a problem. The usual explanation for familial affection evolving is that since my brother shares half of my genes, from a genetic perspective it is half-selfish for me to look after his welfare. So genes that make me care about my brother tend to spread.

But on this new model where '50%' is shorthand for '50% of the way between virtually all and all', taking care of my brother is about as good as taking care of myself (genetically). And a banana is worthy of my kin affection more than I thought my brother was. All living creatures are my family, and all humankind is myself.

This does not describe my feelings about bananas, and to learn of a basic biological drive for selflessness across vast swathes of the tree of life would be a bit of a surprise.

How does this actually work?
