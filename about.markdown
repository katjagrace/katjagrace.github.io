I'm [Katja Grace](https://katjagrace.com), and may or may not be yet another identity of the universal consciousness, suspiciously claiming to be a further voice in favor of that which is impersonally good.

This blog descends from and tentatively maintains the identity of two older blogs, [Meteuphoric](https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/meteuphoric.html) (aimed at novel insights on issues of lasting concern) and [Worldly Positions](https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/worldlypositions.html) (aimed at recountings of travel and mundane opinions), and also covers the new subject area of 'all other things of interest to Katja'.
