Some confusions about things that are hard to buy:

2. **Why do journals try to charge people like me $30 to read their papers?** I'm almost certainly not going to pay $30 for every paper I want to glance at beyond the abstract, and my impression is that basically nobody is. So why not charge individuals a price that they might plausibly pay? Wouldn't that make more money? For instance, at $0.50/paper, I imagine that I would spend $30 much more often than I spend $30 in the current system. Would this interfere with charging institutions
3. **Why can't I pay small amounts to read paywalled articles on magazines and news sites?** It seems like the set of people who would pay a bit of money to read an article, but would not pay more and more money forever to read all the articles should be huge. Especially when paying for all the articles forever from every interesting content provider would be very expensive, and the things one wants to read are spread across many sources. Even an ongoing subscription to a number of articles from across different venues would seem much better, if the subscription model is important to maintain.
4. **Having reluctantly decided to pay money forever to a small number of online magazines and news sites, why are there so many frictions to doing so successfully?** I subscribed to the Wall Street Journal for a bit, and it never became possible to actually log in to read articles, so I eventually gave up. In the meantime, they sent me a vast number of emails, which was sweet, and I probably signed up for it at some point, but it was still admittedly a relief to end it. I considered signing up for the Economist to try it, but happily read the description of how to unsubscribe, which involved talking to someone on the phone about it, at which point I decided to wait and see if I really wanted it. I think both the Economist and the Atlantic responded to my interest in purchasing a subscription with further options for print subscriptions with prices calibrated to be tempting, so I went away to think about it and never subscribed.



5. **Why are kouign amanns always out?** Koign amanns are the most delicious pastry that I know of. Often I try to buy them, for celebrate or comfort. Many San Francisco outlets nominally offer kouign amanns, but when I try to buy them, they are often out or don't have enough for my small order. Which would make sense if everyone just realized that they were delicious yesterday, so they didn't make enough for all that demand. But they have been around since [1860](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kouign-amann). Why don't they make more? (Actually, apparently many places only noticed them [in 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kouign-amann#Popularity), but still.)


6. Why no single touch to use meditation timer?

another post entitled 'surprisingly bad' - combine?
1. I can't search for the string '.1' in a pdf
2. I can't search in PDFs reliably, or copy-paste from PDFs without getting some random strings from other parts of the page, or
3. I can't read scientific articles unless I steal them or pay >$30 for each paper.
4. I can't read an article unless I sign up to pay its publisher every month until I have the time to talk to them on the phone about how I don't want to.
5. The pool of potential presidential candidates
3. Why doesn't science use rapid feedback commentary, like Reddit?
