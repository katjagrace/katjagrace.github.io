Sometimes I don't want to share my thoughts with the whole internet. No, it's actually fine, most of the internet. I don't want to share my thoughts with my friends, so it is too bad that I don't have an anonymous blog. Man, why didn't I make my blog anonymous. Shoudl I start another anonymous blog, and quote it sometimes?

Can I really write while I'm walking? Can I write while I'm standing? Somehow that is easier.

Maybe I'll write some fiction, that seems like it might satisfy the above.
