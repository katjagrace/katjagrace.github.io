"Oh no, there are ants in the bread drawer too now!"

"Yeah, alas."

"Do you think it's time to kill them?"

"Not really, no"

"They are growing in number. They could turn into a real problem."

"Yeah, but they are alive, they gave goals, and they are going around achieving them with their ant friends, and killing them is a pretty intense response to your annoyance"



My house had some ants recently, so we got to the moral question of whether and how to kill them. We waited a bit to see if they would go away, but then most people preferred to kill them. I was fairly opposed, which I think put me in the crankish and non-consequentialist seeming camp. Before I try to become more reasonable, I'd like to try out defending myself.

The basic argument for killing the ants is that they are annoying us. I think at the point we decided to kill them, they had done maybe five dollars of damage in eating foods (or more fairly, eating tiny portions of foods, such that we were compelled by our prejudice to destroy those foods). If a person did five dollars of damage to your food, nobody would say you should kill them. That's ok, you say: ant lives are way less valuable than human lives. But how much less valuable? I ask. Is it a billion times less? In that case, if a person annoyed you to the tune of $100 million dollars, would it be ok for you to kill them?

It's true that I'm being apparently non-consequentialist, but almost nobody is straightforwardly 'consequentialist' in deciding when to kill people out of annoyedness. I'm just applying the same kind of thing to ants.

basic issue: difference between human caes and ants case is quantitative, and you have no idea of the scael. i.e. the difference between you and I is not that I am not being consequentialist, it is that I am being non-consequentialist about smaller or more helpless creatures.

second basic issue: i'm not sure in general that someone working on x-risk should make them more allowed to kill things. just as far as social norms go, it doesn't seem good.

other issue: ?

You say that I have to be willing to kill ants at some point. What am I going to do? Just let them take over my house, until everything is continually crawling with them? The fact that I have to kill something at some point though doesn't make doing it now ok. I have to kill a person at some point,
