Another thing I found interesting about The hunchback of notre dame was the gap between the story that appears to be presented, and that people seem to mostly take away from it, and the story that appears to be actually going on, if you don't take cues from the presentation.




The central story is of Quasimodo, a young man with a deformed face, compelled to remain in the bell-tower of Notre Dame Cathedral for fear that he will be shunned by society, as promised by his officious and corrupt guardian, minister of Justice Frollo. On a brief illicit foray into the town he is indeed abused and mocked, but rescued by a Gypsy woman, Esmerelda. She follows him into the cathedral, and long story short a kiss on the cheek leaves him hopeful. Frollo hopes to murder all of the Gypsies, but Quasimodo and the handsome, heroic leader of the guard Phoebus, attempt to stop him, and

On the face of it, the story is one of an outcast doubting that he might be worthy of care, but learning that looks aren't everything, and that good people will respect him anyway. xxx[not the same? -->]At least this is the message that [viewers](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-hunchback-of-notre-dame-1996/user-reviews/child) get: 'don't judge a book by its cover', 'about accepting people'. "The buried story of the film--the lesson some younger viewers may learn for the first time--is that there is room in the world for many different kinds of people, for hunchbacks and gypsies as well as for those who scornfully consider themselves the norm." - Ebert

But if you pay more attention, you realize that the simple story suggested is that of Quasimodo's narrative (and probably Disney's), and not reliable.  

In his story of the central importance of his ugliness means that he interprets everyone else's actions as about that. People won't like him because he is ugly. She doesn't love him because he is ugly.

He imagines (or ...) at one point rising above his xxx, but even then his imagined victorious story is merely that she likes his ugliness, compared to all those other men who are the same. Still revolves around his appearance—in his fantasy, she loves him because of his unusualness, of his face. He remains nothing but his face. While he may think this is an escape from the clutches of social sanction, it has wrecked him more than he knows - his escape from being an ugly face is merely into being a differently understood ugly face.

While he reassures himself that he is unique and therefore better than those men who are all the same, Phoebus—while looking 'the same'—is genuinely unique in important ways. Upon being called by Frollo to lead the guard and help in crushing the Gypsies, he xxx. While the cityfolk abuse Quasimodo, he asks permission to intervene. He refuses to follow orders to burn a family alive in their house, and when Frollo does it himself, Phoebus runs into the bonfire and pulls out the whole family. Frollo attempts to summarily execute him, but he bravely escapesxxx, before being shot and falling into a river where they leave him to drown. Recovering later, he hears xxx and rallies, saying they must xxx.

Quasimodo meanwhile, upon hearing that Esmerelda may like Phoebus rather than him, is tentatively uninterested in stopping the genocide of the Gypsies. Which is arguably a very human response—romantic jealousy can be a powerfully terrible force. But still, Quasimodo's character is at best deserving of pity, not awe.

Esmerelda righly feels pity for and interest in Quasimodo, and love for Phoebus. If their looks had been reversed, it's not obvious to me that she would have felt differently.

So because of his powerfully reinforced story of his own mistreatment, he lived in a fantasy world oppressed by figments of his imagination, and never truly saw the woman he loved, or the world that he could have had.

The moral of the story is that stigma can often do worse than oppress straightforwardly, if it teaches you that all messages to you are oppression, and so makes you unable to live in a wider world that is not about your oppression, because you can't see it.

[And if in pity for your oppression, nobody feels it is fair to complain about your other flaws, then you may ever labor under the image of all failures flowing from this immovable unfairness, while your tractable problems lie untouched.]

redefines your notion of yourself as centrally about the oppression, and makes you unable to see the real world if it can possibly be seen as the same narrative of oppression. Unable to see opportunities, so faithful that there are none. Unable to see ways out, so assured that they are empty. I think this is an important moral.

Like a person hunched over though there is no longer anything crushing them down, Quasimodo's mind is crippled even where oppression is nought.

So bad it's good, but not in the normal way.

I like the song 'Hellfire'.


I like Frollo. I'm the boss of people. I'm in charge of snacks. I know where Frollo is coming from.

I disagree with Ebert.
