Notes on a conversation with Robin:
- It's a huge loss that amateur thinkers don't put in the effort to get to the forefront of thought on their topics
- People have a strong tendency to be different from one another (e.g. horrified to be caught in the same dress, weird to order the same as their companion, odd to choose the same art) while also having a strong tendency to conform. They are even in the same areas, and the best behavior seems to be balancing on an edge between the two forces. You don't want to wear either a dress that someone else is wearing, nor a dress in a style that hasn't been worn since the 1600s. I'm not sure I had seen these two human forces together in the same realm before, as it seems they are. You don't want your essay to be on an identical topic to another student's, but you also don't want it to be outside the bounds of what the professor thinks of as an essay.
