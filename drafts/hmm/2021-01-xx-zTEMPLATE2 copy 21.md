My email strategy is to slowly watch emails accumulate in my inbox with mounting unease, answering a few but leaving most to stare back at me wrongly, until it reaches some sort of a head, at which point I answer a lot  of them at once in a kind of manic email binge, in which I am fully experience the richness of the communication with me that has been attempted

 o people I've never heard of ask me to do interviews with them and [I do](What low scale actions are you performing? Are they good?).<!--ex-->

My friend advocates for saying that your policy is what it actually is, then maybe considering whether improving it is a priority, rather than describing it aspirationally. I think I like it.
