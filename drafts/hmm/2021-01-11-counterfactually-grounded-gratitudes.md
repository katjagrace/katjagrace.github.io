Individually counterfactually large gratitudes


1. My parents for having me, and for ensuring that I left home and went to university
2. Anna for encouraging me to move to America and Mama for buying me a ticket
3. David Chalmers for advising me in philosophy in undergrad even though I wasn't doing philosophy, and so helping me get into philosophy grad school
4. Nick Bostrom, Robin Hanson and Tyler Cowen for letting me be around the FHI and GMU
3. Luke Muehlhauser for hiring me to MIRI
4. Paul, Joe, Anna, Scott, Ramana, Robin, Ben, Satvik, Steph, John for particularly large intellectual conversation
4. Joe for dating me
5. Ajeya and Joe for being willing to make this house with me
6.

Things different from yesterday

1. Joe for encouraging me to buy lots of medicine in the past that was probably useful today
2.
