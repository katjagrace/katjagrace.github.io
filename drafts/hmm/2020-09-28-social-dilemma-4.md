From yesterday: I think advertisers should expect to make very roughly $25 from me in expectation from this haul (though this is higher because I took the time to look at the ads, which I usually skim more), or around $1.60/ad. (recalculate)


What if you just paid me to target ads at me? Could I get a much higher click-rate? Here is a quick brainstorm:
- Single serve convenience foods in pleasing packaging: 50% of selling $15 thing
- Boody leggings: 80% but 90% will buy at some point, so maybe just hastening that day, lets say 10% extra of $30 item
- Combination art/productivity supplies that look aesthetically pleasing to write on or with while appealing to the notion that they will make you more productive: 30% of $15 item
- Aesthetically pleasing bedroom storage: 20% of $200 item [60 total]
- Marijuana suppliers near me who don't write down your name: not telling, $50 item
- Books that you write things in that somehow involve C.S.Lewis: not telling, $25 item
- Posters of art by Paul Signac (this week) or maybe some preraphaelites: 70% I buy some poster for about $20

Expected $ per ad, after subtracting price of my time to produce list: ~$20
