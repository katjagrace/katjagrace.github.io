In-line rhymes hit my buttons
Sublime like mutton and fine wine
Find a cut and sign

Like, it's not so subtle,
Fine in my mind
I'm cutting fine
cut and sigh
Sitting high
are so fine
get me crying why
set me on fire


in-line rhymes are cheap
keep lining these
so why keep writing heaps
try to sleep
cry
sublime
leaps
keep your fine time
