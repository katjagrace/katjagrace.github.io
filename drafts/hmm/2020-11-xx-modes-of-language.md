When we want to use language with each other, we usually use:
- audible mouth sounds: mostly generated on the fly,
- simple two dimensional symbols

spoken language: mostly generated on the fly - if not, then taken from written language, because we just can't remember well enough the spoken language mostly

they map to each other, roughly - at the level of words at least, and largely at the level of letters/simple sounds.

disabled people also have:
- visual, body + generated on the fly
- touch, recorded

other things we could use:
- touch generated on the fly, e.g. between hands
- audible, recorded (we do this, but by doing it normally with a recording device - similar to if we wrote by doing sign language with a recording device)

we use:
- hands (output, input)
- mouths (output)
- ears (input)
- eyes (input)

Could probably use mouths for input, what with their great sensitivity. Also for button-type input, rather than sound creation.

Could imagine using eyes for output - e.g. they can move a lot, and have subtle expressions

Could also use:
- whole body (output)
- feet/legs (output)
