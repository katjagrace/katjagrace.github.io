maybe people don't give to Africa because they don't believe in Africa, not because they don't care

but wouldn't they then just be on the hook for not bothering to come to believe in it? If they truly cared, and were just unable to act without viewin ga thing in a certain way, then surely they would view it in that way.

No, it doesn't work like that, because they only act on things in their aliefs. And their knowledge that their aliefs have massive gaps in them is just a belief. So they don't intuitively feel like if they

In the world on which they act, Africa doesn't exist in the relevant way, so the idea of taking actions that would cause it to come into view doesn't arise or make sense. They act as if they are in the world represented by the map, they don't have a separate map of how the territory relates to the map.

Seems like they can either drag themselves with explicit reasoning to do the thing, or they can somehow come to viscerally appreciate that their visceral appreciations in general are inaccurate. I think it can be done, a bit.

I tentatively subscribe to the theory that 'beliefs' come in roughly two flavors: analytic and implicit (beliefs and aliefs, system one vs. system two, ..).

I think this belief is much less useful than it could be, because it is an explicit belief, not an alief, so I suspect that I basically don't act on it - I just bring it up in conversation or thinking about it.

But some more evidence that I don't act on it is that reasonbaly often I become viscerally understanding of things i already knew, and I'm like 'wow, I never truly understood that thing!' and I still don't much go around trying to bring this about - it mostly comes about by accident, I think. (I don't really remember examples though, so take this with a grain of salt.) And then sometimes, I think I even then think, 'Wow, I guess viscerally appreciating things is pretty different and important compared to consistently verbally assenting to them' or something like that.

I suspect the trick here is also to somehow alieve that your aliefs are amiss
