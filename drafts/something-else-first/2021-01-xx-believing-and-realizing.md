My boyfriend has a [new blog](https://handsandcities.com/), which I like.

His latest post I think looks at a particularly important thing.

There is a crucial difference between understanding something and 'realizing' it

There is a crucial difference between adding something to your explicit verbal description of the world, and adding it to your 'real world' that contains things like your keys and the prospect of your boss being annoyed with you.

There is a crucial difference between subscribing to the view that there will be massive economic growth this century, and expecting it like you expect to have dinner tonight.

In particular, in general, you will effortlessly act on the latter kinds of things, and may have to go to intense efforts to even notice that you are not acting on the former, so foreign to your intuitive world are your 'beliefs'.

This is of course old hat, but in my experience most old hats are understood and not realized. So I think it important to repeat things, from every direction, in different words, with different images, until you start to actually realize them.

I think I go around all the time understanding things without realizing them

I think *this very point* is in fact one that I have understood but hardly realized

I'm partly hoping that if I say it again and again myself, I will realize it, or not forget that I need to realize it, and hopefully one day, looking at something else, it will dawn on me proper.

Possibly I'll just try to make this point repeatedly until I or someone else gets it.

***

Lots of things you think you believe in, you don't believe in in the relevant way. This probably causes your behavior to make sense in a world that is not the real world.

New important goal: Attempt to realize obvious things

To help realize, here are some angles on the same thing:

1. I keep realizing that it is important to imagine the future

2. I keep realizing that the map is not the territory

3. I suspected for my whole life that the reason other people weren't very interested in donating to the global poor is that they don't really 'believe' that they exist.
