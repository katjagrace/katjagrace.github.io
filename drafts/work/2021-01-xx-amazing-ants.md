Things ants could plausibly do that would be of value to us:
- Get out of our houses before we are driven to expend effort killing them, and similarly for all the other places ants conflict with humans (stinging, eating crops, ..)
- Clean areas of small loose particles or removable substances (e.g. floors, hard to reach crevices, sticky jars in the kitchen, buildup from pipes while water is off)
- Chase out biting insects
- Pest control in agriculture (they have [already been used for this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaver_ant#In_agriculture) since about 400AD)
- spying
- investigate hard to reach situations, underground or in walls for instance - e.g. see whether a pipe is leaking, or whether the foundation of a house is rotting, or whether there is smoke inside a wall
- surveil buildings for [smoke](https://www.goshen.edu/blogs/2014/05/10/ants-smoke-final-survey/#:~:text=So%2C%20today%20we%20spent%20several,the%20ground%20to%20save%20themselves.&text=As%20far%20as%201800m%20away,over%20a%20hundred%20per%20minute!)
- defend areas from invaders, e.g. buildings, cars ([some plants have coordinated with ants in this way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vachellia_drepanolobium#Symbiosis_with_ants))
- Sculpting/moving things at a very small scale
- Building [house-size structures](https://youtu.be/lFg21x2sj-M?t=171) with intricate detailing.
- Digging tunnels (e.g. instead of digging up your garden to lay a pipe, maybe ants could dig the hole, then a flexible pipe could be pushed through it)
- They are used in medication, so can maybe do that more efficiently
- War (attack, guerilla attack, sabeoutage, intelligence)
- Mending things at a small scale, e.g. delivering adhesive material to a crack in a pipe while the water is off
-

Other things ants can do, from Wikipedia unless otherwise noted:
- pheromone trails show where they have been
- they can fly
- they can tell the direction of scents
- ants communicate by feeding from one another's buts
- they do some kind of shortest route finding, by marking trails that are good as they return on successful routes
- they build giant [bivoucs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivouac_(ants)) out of their bodies
- [they can](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaver_ant#Nest_building_behaviour) cooperatively hold down a giant leaf and sew it in place, where even disturbing a few causes them to lose it
- they can 'constructs nests that maintain a relatively constant interior temperature that aids in the development of larvae. The ants maintain the nest temperature by choosing the location, nest materials, controlling ventilation and maintaining the heat from solar radiation, worker activity and metabolism, and in some moist nests, microbial activity in the nest materials.'
- 'Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens.'[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leafcutter_ant#Ant%E2%80%93fungus_mutualism): 'Leaf cutter ants are sensitive enough to adapt to the fungi's reaction to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it...The fungi used by the higher attine ants no longer produce spores. These ants fully domesticated their fungal partner 15 million years ago, a process that took 30 million years to complete.[9] Their fungi produce nutritious and swollen hyphal tips (gongylidia) that grow in bundles called staphylae, to specifically feed the ants.'
- they can measure distances with an internal pedometer
- 'Others are less expansionist, but just as aggressive; they invade colonies to steal eggs or larvae, which they either eat or raise as workers or slaves. Extreme specialists among these slave-raiding ants, such as the Amazon ants, are incapable of feeding themselves and need captured workers to survive.[126] Captured workers of enslaved Temnothorax species have evolved a counter-strategy, destroying just the female pupae of the slave-making Temnothorax americanus, but sparing the males (who do not take part in slave-raiding as adults).[127]'
- 'Aphids and other hemipteran insects secrete a sweet liquid called honeydew, when they feed on plant sap. The sugars in honeydew are a high-energy food source, which many ant species collect.[135] In some cases, the aphids secrete the honeydew in response to ants tapping them with their antennae. The ants in turn keep predators away from the aphids and will move them from one feeding location to another. When migrating to a new area, many colonies will take the aphids with them, to ensure a continued supply of honeydew.'
- 'Myrmecophilous (ant-loving) caterpillars of the butterfly family Lycaenidae (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding areas in the daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night. The caterpillars have a gland which secretes honeydew when the ants massage them.'
- 'Lemon ants make devil's gardens by killing surrounding plants with their stings and leaving a pure patch of lemon ant trees, (Duroia hirsuta). This modification of the forest provides the ants with more nesting sites inside the stems of the Duroia trees.[143] '
-  'Isotopic labelling studies suggest that plants also obtain nitrogen from the ants.[148]'

- scale insect males have legs and wings, but females potentially have no limbs and indistinct head/body difference, and can be kind of like a circle basically https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_insect
