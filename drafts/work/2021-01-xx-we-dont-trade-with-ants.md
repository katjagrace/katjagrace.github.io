In response to the thought that maybe advanced AI would generically trade with humans rather than violently annihilating them, one retort I occasionally hear is 'we don't trade with ants'.

I think it's interesting to ask then why we don't trade with ants, and whether it is relevant.

I think the suggested explanation when this is said is that we are so big, powerful and smart compared with ants that we don't need to trade with them because they are nothing to us; we can just walk over them, they are too small and impotent to register in our society.  We can take anything they have, so there is no incentive to negotiate.

I think this isn't true at all, and is also an interesting case of the classic cognitive error of imagining that trade is about swapping fixed-value objects, rather than creating new value from a confluence of one's needs and the other's eases.

Ants, with their skills, could do a lot that we would plausibly find worth paying for. Some ideas:

- Clean, especially small loose particles or detachable substances, especially in cases that are very hard for humans to reach (e.g. floors, crevices, sticky jars in the kitchen, buildup from pipes while water is off, the outsides of tall buildings)
- Chase away other insects
- Pest control in agriculture (they have [already been used for this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaver_ant#In_agriculture) since about 400AD)
- spying
- investigate hard to reach situations, underground or in walls for instance - e.g. see whether a pipe is leaking, or whether the foundation of a house is rotting, or whether there is smoke inside a wall
- surveil buildings for [smoke](https://www.goshen.edu/blogs/2014/05/10/ants-smoke-final-survey/#:~:text=So%2C%20today%20we%20spent%20several,the%20ground%20to%20save%20themselves.&text=As%20far%20as%201800m%20away,over%20a%20hundred%20per%20minute!)
- defend areas from invaders, e.g. buildings, cars ([some plants have coordinated with ants in this way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vachellia_drepanolobium#Symbiosis_with_ants))
- Sculpting/moving things at a very small scale
- Building [house-size structures](https://youtu.be/lFg21x2sj-M?t=171) with intricate detailing.
- Digging tunnels (e.g. instead of digging up your garden to lay a pipe, maybe ants could dig the hole, then a flexible pipe could be pushed through it)
- They are used in medication, so can maybe do that more efficiently
- War (attack, guerilla attack, sabeoutage, intelligence)
- Mending things at a small scale, e.g. delivering adhesive material to a crack in a pipe while the water is off
- Surveillance of scents (including which direction a scent is coming from), e.g. drugs, explosives, diseases, people, microbes
- tending other small, useful organisms ('Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens.'[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leafcutter_ant#Ant%E2%80%93fungus_mutualism): 'Leaf cutter ants are sensitive enough to adapt to the fungi's reaction to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it...The fungi used by the higher attine ants no longer produce spores. These ants fully domesticated their fungal partner 15 million years ago, a process that took 30 million years to complete.[9] Their fungi produce nutritious and swollen hyphal tips (gongylidia) that grow in bundles called staphylae, to specifically feed the ants.' 'The ants in turn keep predators away from the aphids and will move them from one feeding location to another. When migrating to a new area, many colonies will take the aphids with them, to ensure a continued supply of honeydew.' ''Myrmecophilous (ant-loving) caterpillars of the butterfly family Lycaenidae (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding areas in the daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night. The caterpillars have a gland which secretes honeydew when the ants massage them.'')
- measuring hard to access distances (they measure distance as they walk with an internal pedometer)
- Killing plants (lemon ants make 'devil's gardens' by killing all plants other than 'lemon ant trees' in an area)
- Producing and delivering nitrogen to plants ('Isotopic labelling studies suggest that plants also obtain nitrogen from the ants.[148]')
- Get out of our houses before we are driven to expend effort killing them, and similarly for all the other places ants conflict with humans (stinging, eating crops, ..)

We can't take almost any of this by force, we can at best kill them and take their dirt and the minuscule mouthfuls of our foods they were eating.

Could we pay them for all this?

A single ant eats about 2mg per day, so you could support a colony of a million ants with 2kg of food per day. Supposing they accepted pay in sugar, or something similarly expensive, 2kg costs around [$3](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/domino-extra-fine-granulated-sugar-50-lb/104SUGEFG50.html). Perhaps you would need to pay them more than subsistence to attract them away from foraging freely, since food-gathering ants usually collect more than they eat, to support others in their colony. So let's guess $5.

My guess is that a million ants could do well over $5 of the above labors in a day. For instance, a colony of meat ants [takes 'weeks'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_ant#Relationship_with_humans) to remove the meat from an entire carcass of an animal. Supposing somewhat conservatively that this is three weeks, and the animal is a [1.5kg](https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/animals-and-plants/native-animals/native-animal-facts/bandicoots#:~:text=Bandicoots%20are%20about%20the%20size,of%20which%20live%20in%20NSW.&text=The%20long%2Dnosed%20bandicoot%20is,weighs%20up%20to%201.5kg.) bandicoot, the colony is moving 70g/day. Guesstimating the mass of crumbs falling on the floor of a small cafeteria in a day, I imagine that it's less than that produced by tearing up a single bread roll and spreading it around, which the internet says is about 50g. So my guess is that an ant colony could clean the floor of a small cafeteria for around $5/day, which I imagine is cheaper than human sweeping (this site says 'light cleaning' costs around $35/h on average in the US). And this is one of the tasks where the ants have least advantages over humans. Cleaning the outside of skyscrapers or the inside of pipes is presumably much harder for humans than cleaning a cafeteria floor, and I expect is fairly similar for ants.

So at a basic level, it seems like there should be potential for trade with ants - they can do a lot of things that we want done, and could live well at the prices we would pay for those tasks being done.

So why don't we trade with ants?

I claim that we don't trade with ants because we can't communicate with them. We can't tell them what we'd like them to do, and can't have them recognize that we would pay them if they did it. Which might be more than the language barrier. There might be a conceptual poverty. There might also be a lack of the memory and consistent identity that allows an ant to uphold commitments it made with me five minutes ago.

These might be more than what is needed to make valuable trade feasible though. If we could only communicate that their all leaving our house immediately would prompt us to put a plate of honey in the garden for them, then  

their continued presence in our house would lead to their slaughter, and that we had put a plate of honey in the garden for them, I think we would avoid crushing them in this case, since we could presumably pay them very little to get out of our houses at the threat of violence, and we would prefer talk to them than buy baits and put them out and deal with all the bodies, even if we are indifferent to their lives.)

‘We don’t trade with ants’ - true, but that seems maybe due to us not being able to communicate with them (and maybe them not being sophisticated enough to understand what we have to say, if we could, which might be a somewhat different issue). If we could communicate, I think we would prefer to threaten to kill them than to actually do it, at a minimum. And there might be many things they could do that we would happily pay a motivating quantity of sugar syrup for, e.g. cleaning stuff from carpets.

you might think 'but the AI will be so far above us that it will think of itself as unable to communicate with us, in the same way that we can't with the ants - we will be unable to conceive of most of its concepts'

really all we would need is 'go over there and we won't kill you' for our communications to be fruitful, and these aren't concepts at the foggy pinnacle of abstruse human meaning-making-out

[ants can actually do heaps of things we can't. When we get human-level AI, will it also be ant level? Or will AI want to trade with ants for longer than it wants to trade with us?]

Another consideration in our crushing ants instead of e.g. running away from them, that is perhaps going on is that the ants are very small. I think if elephants were building giant structures with rooms and corridors, forming mounds of 70,000 living elephants at night, moving across the countryside in columns, building gardens in which to farm fungi, its less clear how we would react to this. We might have gone to war with them long ago, once we had better weapons. But we mightn't have gotten better weapons because they might have kicked our asses so much, prior to the better weapons.

For AI to be to us as we are to ants, would be for us to be able to do myriad tasks better than the AI, and for the AI will be willing to pay us grandly for them, but for it to be unable to tell us this, or even to warn us to get out of the way. Is this what AI will be like? Not at all. AI will be able to communicate with us, and we will probably be less useful to AI than ants could be to us. Looking at our treatment of ants says nothing about how a more capable species treats a more useless species, and everything about how a larger/more powerful species treats a less powerful species.
