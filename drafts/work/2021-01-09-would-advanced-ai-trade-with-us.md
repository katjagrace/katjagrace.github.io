It is commonly claimed that AI will take all of the jobs, eventually. Because it will be better than humans at everything, so why would humans be given anything to do?

But you might recognize this 'Alice is better at everything than Bob' scenario as the very one often given in introductory economics courses to demonstrate the surprising nature of *comparative advantage*: contrary to intuition, being in every way better does not get you all of the jobs. In fact in this scenario, Bob should work on whatever his comparative advantage is, i.e. whatever Alice is relatively worse at, even if she is best at everything. Similarly, AI existing that is better at everything than humans does not on its own imply that humans are out of work.

Against the different thought that AI systems will 'take over the world' and kill everyone, such that the market analysis is not really applicable, a natural more economically literate response is also, 'would it prefer destroy everything rather than trade with us? Why?'

Won't the AI trade with us?

I think the main reason these arguments for trade don't work is that if you push the wage down low enough, then humans cannot subsist on it. The question for whether all humans are out of work is not whether AI is better at everything than humans, but whether AI is better at everything *at a price that humans cannot live on*. In the basic comparative advantage scenario, Bob ends up xxx So if the market does its thing and continues to provide humans with their comparatively advantageous roles, but for instance Bob does the work that $1 of computing time could do on the margin, then Bob will be paid less than $1.

[but can we actually argue that $1 is not enough?

Though in my economic ignorance, I’m actually not sure how to make this argument, that the price actually will be pushed below subsistance. The price of Bob’s work is pushed down to the marginal cost of running a machine that would do Bob’s work. Running a machine is generically cheaper than running a human, but the marginal cost of running another machine in a given extremely machine-rich situation seems less clear. e.g. do we have to build it?
