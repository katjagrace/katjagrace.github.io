Seems like Rohin is right in thinking VNM doesn't imply goal-directedness.

It seems to me that VNM implies movement from some set of minds to some other set of minds, but fear of things becoming terrifying agents all over the place needs a stronger argument that all kinds of things get sucked into the vortex of agenthood, from nearby states.

VNM doesn't seem able to provide that. But what about in conjunction with picking up common human preferences for simplicity and 'consistency' in the sense of many considerations being considered unimportant, and a desire for decisions to be the same, modulo unimportant considerations?

VNM doesn't imply goals because for a given history of behavior, you can always define a utility function for which that was reasonable. e.g. the one where you prefer that history to any other history. But from the inside, if you actually do have something like a utility function, that is you are evaluating states, there is pressure for it not to be that one, if you start out with preferences for non-arbitrariness or simplicity. And the pressure to be different comes from what is going on inside, not how the thing can be conceptualized from the outside.

It seems humans generally move toward being more coherent about more simply described utility functions, because they find they prefer a dollar to a candy in this decision, and a candy to a dollar in that, and then also they have a further view or preference that there is no important difference between the situations and that therefore their choices should be the same in both.
