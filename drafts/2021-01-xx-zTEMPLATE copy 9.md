I went to holiday with my boyfriend's family in Carmel-by-the-Sea. Some thoughts:

1. Often

2. We saw many harbor seals lolling on beaches. It seems that they, upon being born, lie around there for some time. Large and small seals are splayed on the sand. They come in a variety of tasteful brown-grey palates, and a range of sizes. Sometimes they lumber on their stomachs—sometimes fast even—into the sea, and lie around there instead. There were signs saying that the lying around was ok. It seemed kind of wild that we come across these bands of alien sausage-creatures yelping on the beach, and we investigate, and decide that—whatever on earth it might be to be such a creature, we think that lying on the beach a lot is ok for them, and not a sign that they have a problem. Like, it's just somehow weird that we have views on what circumstances are acceptable for these alien creatures.
