Podcasts I've especially enjoyed lately:

- rob wiblin?
- Misha Saul on Rob Wiblin
- axr..
- Ezra Klein and George Saunders: in which Ezra's
- this american life: firefighters and pandemic

I notice that some of what makes me excited about some podcasts and not others is not the topics or interestingness of their discussion. It's something about the warmth and energy between the people.

Seems like everyone is getting into podcasts these days but there are some that i want to see that i haven't . They all have a fairly similar vibe. it's a form that allows much broader engagement - like you don't just have to talk to people who would have written intellectual blog posts on the topics that you are talking about.

I want to see podcasts with:
- people who live in the bednet distribution areas, about how they see these projects, and EA, and x-risk
- someone who voted Trump the first time, on how they see the political landscape at the moment
- Your mum
