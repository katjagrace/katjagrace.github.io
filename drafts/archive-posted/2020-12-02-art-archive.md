The stylization of art can portray the world vividly in ways that it is subtly, and so add details to the real world.

The idea of art about nature doesn't sound exciting to me in the abstract. Perhaps I remember that I am evolutionarily supposed to see it and go, 'oh fantastic, it's green and blue near each other, maybe I'm in for some reproductive success', and that doesn't sound very inspiring. (Yes, I know that simple evolutionary situations can feel inspiring from the inside.)

But a kind of art about nature that I can especially get behind is that which to me evokes some of wild alien vigor of nature, that I sometimes experience for instance sitting in my overgrown back garden, contending with a flock of ascendent giant poppy faces and a stilled frenzy of branches gaining ground and sky about my seat.

It is a sharp exotic aliveness, an electric intent for living that asks to overwhelm the strictures of physical space and come curling and unfolding through the air, with an explosive energy that has no truck with time. As though its papery frills and coils are just what happens where that timeless lightening of unintelligible eyeless intent sears through the world.


Not alien like an alien mind, but more like an alien spirituality, that doesn't know anything so mundane as minds. But while you revere under the perfect spires of goodness, comes in unexpected and unintelligible from the edges and without looking you in the eye, just overwhelms you with how what really made the world is intensely here and intensely not in your understanding.

How this was always the world, the stark real world, with its microscopic tubules and bare sun-faces, and true spirituality isn't that of human stories.

"Everything wants to live", my botanist grandfather would explain to me. Perhaps for plants it is often more borderline whether living is in store. Because their unrelenting striving for it is more visceral to me than that of other living things. Animals are more placidly set in their bodies. Plants take every opportunity to push outwards, expanding into new limbs and thickening out old ones in their unthinking, unfailing fervor.

A lot of nature in art isn't like this. Often it is idyllic, or realistic, or sleepy furniture for a human story. But here is some art that does portray it, for me, though I don't know if the artists actually meant to:

I have some of the same image with these lines:

>“Reduced to a Gothic skeleton, the abbey is penetrated by beauty from above and below, open to precisely those elements it had once hoped to frame for pious young men, as an object for their patient contemplation. But that form of holy concentration has now been gone longer than it was ever here. It was already an ancient memory two hundred years ago, when Wordsworth came by. Thistles sprout between the stones. The rain comes in. Roofless, floorless, glassless, “green to the very door”—now Tintern is forced to accept the holiness that is everywhere in everything.” - [Zadie Smith, Some notes on Attunement](http://www.jonimitchell.com/Library/originals/jmOriginal_2543.pdf)

spirituality without mind or eye contact

portray the world as slightly different worlds with simpler or stronger versions of aspects of this world, bringing out different aspects of the real world and strengthening them until the viewer might naturally see the aspect of the world that the artist saw.

Art can stylize the world in ways that let the viewer naturally see something that the artist saw in the real world.

 Different ways of drawing the world can strengthen obscure aspects of it until the viewer naturally sees in a scene more of what the artist saw in it.

 Art can stylize the world in ways that let the viewer see things that were subtle in reality.

 The stylization of art can portray the world in ways that it is, but too subtly.

 The stylization of art can portray the world vividly in ways that it is subtly, and so show you the real world anew.

 The stylization of art can portray details of the world that would have been subtle first seen in reality

 One way to think of art is as presenting a stylized view of the world, that makes vivid some aspect of reality that wouldn't have been obvious in


 Like an unseeing intent, a vigorous electric passion for living.
