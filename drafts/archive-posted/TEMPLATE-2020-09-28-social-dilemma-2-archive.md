A thing I liked about *The Social Dilemma* was the evocative image of oneself being in a contest for one's attention with a massive and sophisticated data-nourished machine, tended by teams of manipulation experts. The hopelessness of the usual strategies&mdash;like spur-of-the-moment deciding to 'try to use social media less&mdash;in the face of such power is palpable.

But [another question](https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/10/26/the-social-dilemma-review.html) I have is whether this basic story of our situation&mdash;that sophisticated and powerful advertiser-funded efforts are fluently manipulating our behavior through the apps and websites we use&mdash;is true.

Some contrary observations and speculations from my own life:
- The phenomenon of spending way too long doing apparently pointless things on my phone, and wanting to do them in the middle of more virtuous activities, seems to be at least as often caused by things that are not apparently massively honed to manipulate me. For instance, I enjoy playing [nonograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram), a kind of visual logic puzzle that was [invented by two people independently in the 80s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram#History) and which I play in one of many somewhat awkward-to-use phone apps, I assume made by small teams mostly focused on making the app work smoothly. My sense is that if I didn't have nonograms style games or social media or news to scroll through, then I would still often idly pick up my phone and draw, or read books, or learn Spanish, or memorize geographic facts, or scroll through just anything on offer to scroll through (I also do these kinds of things already). So my guess is that it is my phone's responsiveness and portability and tendency to do complicated things if you press buttons on it, that makes it a risk for time consumption. Facebook's efforts to grab my attention probably don't hurt, but I don't feel like they are most of the explanation for phone-overuse in my own life.
- Notifications do grab my attention pretty straightforwardly, but this strategy appears to have about the sophistication of going up to someone and tapping them on the shoulder all the time, when you have a sufficiently valuable relationship that they can't just break it off you annoy them too much. It isn't some genius manipulation technique, it's just that Facebook is valuable in other ways, so it can incur costs upon me. If I get unnecessary notifications, I am often annoyed and try to stop them or destroy the thing causing them.
- I do often scroll down feeds for longer than I might have planned to, but the same thing also sometimes happens when I do a Google Image search for skin infections, or open some random report and forget why I'm looking at it. So I think scrolling down things might be a pretty natural behavior for things that haven't finished yet, and are interesting at all.
- A thing that feels attractive about Facebook is that one wants to look at things that other people are looking at. (Thus for instance reading books and blog posts that just came out over older, better ones.) Social media have this, but presumably not much more than newspapers did before, since a greater fraction of the world was looking at the same newspaper before.

In sum, I offer the alternate theory that various technology companies have combined:
- pinging people
- about things they are at least somewhat interested in
- that everyone is looking at
- situated in an indefinite scroll
- on a responsive, detailed pocket button-box

...and that most of the attention-suck and influence that we see is about those things, not about the hidden algorithmic optimizing forces that Facebook might have.

idly picking up my phone at every moment seems to [actually i probably do pick it up to see what's going on more for notifications]


- While the story that I look at my phone too much because dark forces are optimizing for it is compelling, I'm not sure. For instance, I also look at my phone a lot to do things
- I wonder how you would solve this problem


What does Facebook advertise to me today?
- Gates foundation plans to improve math education
- something you put in your ears to make sounds less annoying
- a kind of exercise object that I searched for yesterday because I found one in my garage, but if I hadn't, I might be interested
- 6x political candidates (I'm a foreigner who can't vote)
- a kind of non-coffee somewhat drugged brown water, which is a kind of thing I'm interested in but pretty weird because my recent thinking about this has mostly been in discussion with housemates in the kitchen.
- the new oculus quest, a VR machine that my housemate just got so I just tried for the first time, but have also not searched for online, that I recall. Though maybe I looked up on my phone whether The Witness could be played in VR recently. I'm not about to buy one though.
- some other kind of mild drugs as drink, this time alcohol-themed
- humorous T-shirts that I don't find funny and also I find it somewhat hard to imagine a scenario where I buy a humorous t-shirt
- Borat movie, which ad suggests to me there is very little chance that I will like
- the National Academy of Sciences is looking for nominations for a prize, in an ad I would have missed if I wasn't looking for ads
- Fitness program that I probably would have skimmed over, but I guess it looks maybe interesting
-


- I enjoyed the bizarre social interactions of the narrativized bits. I am not sure whether it was meant to represent a future dystopia, parts of the world that are now worse than I think, or if acting is just hard.
