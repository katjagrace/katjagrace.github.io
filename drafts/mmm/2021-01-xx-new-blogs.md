summary:
---
[Hands and Cities](https://handsandcities.com/) in which my boyfriend explicates his worldview and attempts to make you realize obvious things
[Underconfidence](https://underconfidence.com/) in which my colleague apparently doesn't want to write a blog but fails

[Astral Codex Ten](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/) in which my ex-boyfriend reappears after a clash with the NYT

Intriguing newish blogs that I haven't read much by other people I'm a bit familiar with:

Richard Fisher, of the BBC, interviewed me https://longtermist.substack.com/

https://longtermist.substack.com/p/the-importance-of-existential-hope

https://modelcitizen.substack.com/p/google-with-me

Exciting blogs by other people I'm close to:
overcoming bias
paul's blogs



Extra blog on hold for more than a year, which I wish was alive: https://thegazebo.blog/

Oh yeah! Long live the blogosphere!
