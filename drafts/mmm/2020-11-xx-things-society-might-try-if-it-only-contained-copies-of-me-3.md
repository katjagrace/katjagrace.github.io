([Part 1](https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2020/11/21/things-society-might-try-if-it-only-contained-copies-of-me-1.html), [Part 2])

1. **Headpieces for talking in loud places**

2. **Public baths.** Preferably as the central public meeting places of aforementioned adult dorms.

3. **Places you can go at any time to take part in experiments for money and fun**

4. **Places you can go at any time to meet** (with selection processes in place, but you go there in the physical world, like a cross between a bar and okc)

Speed meeting/dating, probably also that you just show up to at one of these places

**Experiments regarding social norms**


Social club dining halls. And generally more things like dorm dining halls or marketplaces, where you can go at any point that you feel like socializing with the subset of people who might be at one.

don't have to plan socializing weeks ahead, so can be based on your feeling
Can use up gaps
aren't committed to hours of talking to a particular person before you start
Can do it while you eat without a lot of overhead or expense

Zero-time payment at restaurants. if not some new techy solution, just pay bill at the start, then do it again if you order more. Or you just leave your email address when you order, and they PayPal charge you for everything at the end without hassling you about it more.

Basic level lying desk setups

You can get really expensive ones, or you can attach half-keyboards to a deck chair yourself.

[not added but not sure now] Sleep-hygiene-willpower-help-services You buy a subscription, and then at night you can go there, and you start out in glorious complex of darkish rooms with delicious nightcaps and amusing (orange) video games and soft things and cuddling and hot tubs and massages and hypnotic images. Then after a set time that you can’t control, they eject you into a dark sound-insulated sleeping place with freshly washed sheets and only minor amusements available.


Communication by touch (I kind of already said this)

Sign language
