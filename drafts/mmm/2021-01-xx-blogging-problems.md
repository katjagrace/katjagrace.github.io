I want to blog every day, thinking that situation where you readily write online (like you readily say things) is better than this thing where nobody wants to say things in public (and here I would like to give a full explanation of the incentive dynamics of online writing, but I don't have the time), yet there is this pressure to say good things, so you have to fight the pressure and get over it and just do it. So I've tried to do that, and I've posted every day for over four months, but it hasn't gotten that easy. I often stay up late, then post something stupid. And I never write extensive, good posts. Should I give up? Should I modify my behavior some other way? Should I make it ten posts a day, then see if going back to one makes it easy, like with speed reading training? I feel like I have lots of ideas for good posts, but they all need longer to write well, and they deserve to be written well, so I put them aside as drafts. Which is also what I used to do when I had all the time in the world to blog, so that's suspicious. Perhaps I just think everything should be written in the perfect future, when writing clarity onto a page, with thrilling beauty, will be easy. (If I do think that, then what?)

Maybe I should spend some time each day blogging, rather than putting something up each day? That sounds un-virtuous in ways.

I also never write beautiful things, and hardly ever take stands. Which feels like because I don't have the time. But again, I also never seemed to have the time before.

I also wanted my blog to track more what I'm actually thinking about, and I don't currently feel like it does. I hoped I could run everything together into one thing, by writing about what I had been thinking about or working on. But there are so many reasons to not want to talk about a thing in public. Maybe there are ways of talking about things in public that I haven't properly exploited? Fiction, for instance. But that takes time again.
