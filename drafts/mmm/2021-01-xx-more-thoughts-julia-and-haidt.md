My impression is that a basic difference in whether you think what is good must be able to be cashed out in what is good for people, and perhaps further, what is good for particular person-moments, or whether the world can be worse even while it isn't worse for individuals. Though this doesn't necessarily explain the difference between Julia and Sandel. Also, whether it can be worse for someone while it seems better for them.

My guess is that characteristically, people who really believe in the other foundations answer differently from Julia in one of those other questions.

So for Julia to understand their position, perhaps she should imagine what it would be for those things to be false, or at least to feel a motivation to doubt them:



A few other random thoughts on the episode:

Relatedly, Haidt suggests that a world where there are different cities with different 'morals' would be good, which may be so, but I think if they were genuinely morals in the sense of views about what is actually goood, rather than preferences about their own environment, nobody would be happy with that. It's no good if people are torturing children in New York, even if you don't have to be around it: the contention is that torturing children is bad beyond your distaste for it, either in some objective reckoning, or in some kind of summing over subjective experiences (i.e. it is still bad for the children involved, and maybe for the torturers, even if you don't have to see it). To the extent that views about e.g. desecration of sacred objects are about what is good or bad, not what one likes to be around, it's also bad if they are doing it in New York.

the two repeatedly talk about the potential good of these other moral foundations, but then note that they are talking in utilitarian terms again, trying to justify them all in terms of the ones julia likes. And surely that is no good - they are proper 'foundations' for some people.

I'm not sure if they need to not be ultimately about harm, as long as the aversion doesn't feel likee eit is about harm, but rather feels like it has its own flavor. i.e. the thing is so universally assoociated with bad outcomes consequentially, that peoople have developed a brute distaste for it that acts as a shoorotcut and doeosn't need too always be traced back to a particular harm. I think of honesty as much like this often, for people who are less into the conservative vaules. To me at least, it is pretty hard to feel ok lying to a friend, even if I don't see a consequentialist way it's going to go wrong. I'm inclined to otry to justify it in coonsequentialist terms, but in terms ofo owhat is actually going oon: i have a brute aversion too lying and am trying to justify it. It sure didn't come from consequentialism, except insooofar as consequentialist incentives brought about my brute distaste earlire.

It doesn't seem to me like any of them are fundamentally utilitarianism, a real utilitarian wouldn't care about care or fairness either - they are also justifiable in terms

I'm curious where honesty comes in. To me that and keeping commitments feel like the most powerful non-consequentialist moral inclinations.

Another one I wonder about is reciprocity. I feel like that is a big thing in morality (e.g. evolutionary theory seems to start out by focusing on that). Julia asks where people's saying not having children is immoral fits in terms of moral foundations, and that is my guess. It's a somewhat strange form of reciprocity because you don't pay back the person who benefitted you, but I think paying it forward is a variation on this. I guess maybe it counts as 'fairness' or 'loyalty'? Somehow it seems more basic -

Morality is about what is actually good, not from a particular person's perspective.  It's not clear whether this is a meaningful concept, or what it is, but that is a different issue. Supposing there is such a thing, it can come apart from whether you shudder, would judge someone, would want to be friends with someone, or want to ban a thing:
- If you don't personally enjoy a thing, there is a further question of whether the universe is better or worse if another person does it

For instance, I rarely enjoy basic puns, and if people do, I tend to feel like they have poor taste. In the sense that they are wrongly taking a non-beautiful thing to be beautiful, and failing to see beautiful things. I wouldn't wish for them to stop making puns, given that .

There is also both instinctive and deliberate judgment. I find myself judging people sometimes if they smell very bad. But if smelling very bad is immoral, in that it makes the world worse, it is certainly nowhere near as bad as something like choosing an ineffective career. But

Incidentally, I think the abortion debate should have more of this: 'I think it is wrong, but it is a hard philosophical problem and in the absence of agreement among people, it should be a personal choice, in which I encourage people to consider seriously the gravity of the action they are making a choice about.'
