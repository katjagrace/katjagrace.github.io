For Valentine's day, my boyfriend and I went on a virtual art gallery trip. This was an 'outing' that I'd been suggesting for months, though admittedly it didn't sound to me like it would be especially good; I just like to try things. But it was actually great&mdash;among the best date activities I know.

We took over the living room, ordered Japanese food and put it all over the coffee table, and chose [Google Arts and Culture](https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/luncheon-on-the-grass/twELHYoc3ID_VA) as the source of our art. We got it up on the big projector screen. Then we lounged about on the sofa and ate the food while we viewed art, one piece at a time, and thought about it together.



We probably got through about six artworks in this way over a couple of hours, including an extended foray into reading 'The Lady of Shalott' by Alfred Lord Tennyson, by way of comprehending the most famous of its illustrations.

Why was this so good?

- it answers what I really want in a movie

- or anything - this is off the frontier

- it is more together than an art gallery

- it is surprisingly easy to really deeply investigate a thing, with someone else there at your side to talk about it, once you actually get them there. you are using the usual other-person energy to propel you forward.
related to this, we now both remember a lot about the particular artwork that we looked at. It would have been hard to look for twenty minutes before moving on, on my own. And probably just physically, standing up!

- you can quickly change what you are exploring and learn a lot, from a giant computer screen. When our first painting was considered to be somehow referencing another painting, we could go and investigate that one. When we were curious about how the era affected that one, we could go and look at other art from that time. When we wanted to know about the Lady of Shallot, we could just get up the poem.

- You can zoom in a lot. Also true of art at eye-level where you are allowed to stand close, but that isn't always so.

- art galleries are exhausting, and that matters!





I liked how you could really experience the thing together

really with anything detailed, it is hard to experience it with another person. hard to watch a movie really together, or read the internet together, or write something together. often i think couples end up with a trade-off between doing more together activities and more otherwise rich activities which are harder to share every detail of in a finegrained way, at great speed. often we will write philosophical blog posts alone, or we will watch youtube videos together. this seems like it is way off that frontier. You can both see the great detail of the whole thing together, and both

One way this was better than an actual art gallery trip is that art galleries are exhausting! At the end of an extensive gallery trip is just the kind of time one wishes to be lounging on a sofa eating something delicious. And this way, you already are, all along!   

But also, I didn't really expect this to work, because in a real art gallery I wouldn't expect it to: I'd expect people to have not that much to say, and to always want to be wandering on to the next piece at different times, and to be interested in different things, so that if a couple were tied to each other, it would be a continual source of frustration. One might expect this to be even worse, not only saddling my partner to me,

Another way is that you can really zoom in a lot,

(It seemed that various galleries are more intending to be used as virtual tours, but as far as I could tell this involved more awkward navigation of 3D spaces and less looking at art. Google Arts and Culture also has a gallery view where you can see a whole exhibition room and experience light reflecting off the middle of paintings and the distortion from some paintings being five feet above you)

actually remember the pieces we looked at

 we both remember all the paintings

 lady of shallot thing was like a block that will stick around

 he had that wanting to look at different things feeling during the fake-gallery part

 it somehow helped with this

 also reduced the overwhelm

A thing I often regret abouot watching things, as an activity with another pesroon, is that it dosen't feel with enouogh. Foor most of a movie, you are just touoching them and feeling their presence. Which is great, but for the whole experience ofo the movie, for your mind interfacing with the plot and the characters, the other person's preseence is just youro imagining of it, plus perhaps what you can garner from snatching glimpses ofo their face. I like stopping during movies to chat, but otoher peple like this less. I'd like a movie where youo can somehow talk the entire time, while watching the movie. Like if youo had twoo time dimensions, and could have a conoversationo at each moment of the movie, without slowing doown its foorward motiono through time.

But art is only two dimensionoal, so it can be like this.

Ymmv. For instance, I have no idea how many boys would talk to me about art for hours, or whether I got lucky there. For what it's worth, I wasn't expecting this to work.
