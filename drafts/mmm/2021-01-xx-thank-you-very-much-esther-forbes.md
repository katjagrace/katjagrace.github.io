My interest in George Saunders has been growing since I came across one of his essays in a book of essays I made for myself for Christmas 2019. It caught my attention by being both a bright immediately grabbing page turner rather than requiring exertion to force its dusty images into my mind, and yet also being genuinely deep. Not like 'yeah, it passes at being deep, you can feel ok about your page turning'. But like lit by genuine beauty and insight, rather than cheap attention to curiosity-hijacking trivialities. And it wasn't even just deep in one way. It was [enunciated the edges of the world with [relish]] sensitive/receptive and spiritual like Leonard Cohen, and insightful like Robin Hanson.

I think I remarked on this to my boyfriend, who pointed me to an essay by Saunders that he had read, [The Incredible Buddha boy](https://www.gq.com/story/ram-bornjon-miracle-meditating), in which the author travels to the jungles of Nepal to report on the situation with a boy who had purportedly been meditating there for seven months without food or water. This mostly caught my attention for being laugh out loud funny, in a kind of Scott Alexanderish way. But looking at it again, it is also a spiritually clarifying look at things. The fact that this boy is reported to be doing some kind of magic trick could have been a piece of trivia, flippantly wowed at. But instead it's an opportunity to look at the world, really.

This one seemed to me to have less of a propositional point or single deep insight, but it also isn't just the relaying of the situation. Or rather, first he really groks the situation. I mean really groks it. then he relays the situation, grokked. In this way, he reminds me of my boyfriend, with whom discussion of anything is somehow deeper and more important than exactly the same topic seemed earlier. In looking at the temple, he has his eye on the prize also, and sees why the temple is significant, and tells you.

On holiday in Seattle this year, but unwilling to enter buildings with other people for more than a couple of minutes, thoroughly masked, my boyfriend and I got to reading more essays aloud to one another, in our airbnb, and waiting outside to go home.

Recently I hit upon the incredible idea of actually buying a whole book of his essays. And I think my new favorite is 'Thank you Esther Forbes'. It
