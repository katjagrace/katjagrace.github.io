I've been hiding in my room for the last three days, since my housemate came down with a fever and digestive upset. She now doesn't have a fever, but it seems nobody has had time to answer for the internet such questions as 'if I have a fever for a day, and then cool down, does that mean it's not covid?' (or actually as far as I can tell, any questions of the form 'if [symptoms and personal statistics] what is distribution over probable causes?', so that's endlessly confusing).

We've all had some negative results on tests with lots of false negatives. I actually don't know if I could have managed a positive if you paid me and I had covid, so hopeless was I at getting the pointy thing up my nose correctly.

I like to think that if you paid me a million dollars to eat a live worm, I would do it. But in my imagination it seems like maybe I just wouldn't somehow.

My first time tentatively probing inches of flexible plastic skewer into the soft inner regions of my face reminded me of this thought experiment. One part of my mind: 'You have to do the test properly! One of the household could die or be permanently crippled by covid if you don't!' Right. So. I would edge the tip deeper into the flesh of the deep facial subterranean places, or whatever it is one has behind one's nose,  I have no idea what back there, 'until I reached the xxx' (test kit makers, this is not a helpful instruction!). Whatever face innards are like, mine seemed to be designed to resist being poked with sharp things, and sent a series of expressive messages to my brain about it, which my brain kept finding fairly compelling, in spite of my initial intention to really poke that thing in there.

One issue was the vague rumor present in our garden that afternoon that one's brain was nearby on the other side of the pharolyngual somethingxxx, and that you probably couldn't poke it, you know, unless you really fucked up..  I took out the  and looked at it sadly. I tried numerous times, hoping each one that my courage would stay firm. I think I just never really believed in the safety of the deeper poke. I would put the thing in, and go till I 'met resistance' — the pharolingual xxx? 'Is it in?' I'd ask my socially distanced spectators. They would peer at me across the garden and say no, I hardly even have the tip in. It's meant to go in multiple inches. I got a negative, but I never really deserved a positive.

The next day in my room, I approached the same test a second time. This time I would be prepared. I would gather expert advice on how far this thing was meant to go up your nose, then I would mark it on the thing, then I would poke with confidence. My energy and vision in this cause were somewhat depleted by the fact that I had woken up in an unusual room, feeling wretched, with a wreckingsloughingxxx headache, and had thus far achieved eating some sugar, not throwing up, and avoiding panicking about the covid-probability implications of this through a large expenditure of late morning on exploring the reality TV genre. But I found some strength, and approaching the new covid test, that my boyfriend had left outside my door with a little pile of foods and drinks, my strength grew with intent.

I found more detailed instructions online. Ok. The nasopharingular xxx, where I should stop, was 8-10cm in. I should angle across the xxx. I found a set of different detailed instructions. The nasophyllangular xxx was 4-6cm in. Hum.

Another friction in this plan came from the fact that i had no way of measuring lengths handy. So I googled how big a credit card is, then took a credit card and drew around its ends on paper, and turned it sideways and did that again. Then I could replicate the gap between those with my finger marking the side of the credit card. I maneuvered like this, logic-puzzle style, until I had 4cm, the most pessimistically pathetic pharonasular socket length estimate. I opened up my new swab, and marked the needed distance on it with my fingers. I tried to put it up my right nostril just to that probably erroneously short distance. Long before 4cm I met the hurting, 'stop now' places.




I did manage to draw blood with the poking implement. but the chance of covid depends a lot on how likely we think any other possible cause of fever is. A house favorite is 'food poisoning', to which my intuition is like, 'nah'.  

This all led me to be glancing at a list of the varieties of food poisoning. And there I met an entry from my past, which reminded me of one of the worst experiences of my life, which I shall now recount.

I had been traveling with a couple of family members and a friend I had invited, in the back roads of Norway. I had thought this would be fun, but somehow frictions were building. Photographs were being taken for too long when photographs should not be being taken. Presumptions were being presumed. Social errors were flying and hurt was flying back. I was probably a bit lost and shocked, as the person who it seemed was probably obliged to stand up for everyone involved, and also as a person who was used to a very low-conflict lifestyle.

We found yet another obscure fjord to drive down forgotten-looking roads into, and a somewhat run-down building that we had booked to stay in. I had a fairly bad anxiety disorder at the time, and spent decent amounts of the driving time just trying to not be having a full-blown panic attack. Somehow the sheer out-of-the-way-ness of places like this were not helping. (What if I need to escape? What if I need a hospital?) Taking windy roads in an explosively unhappy travel group probably also didn't help.

(Prior to this trip, I had kissed a nice boy, and now I would sometimes find myself for instance standing in a desolate parking lot at the water's edge, below epic mountains, freaking the royal fuck out, and just focusing on the image of his sweet lips, and how one day I would kiss them again..)

Inside our accommodation, tensions seemed to accelerate upward, until it suddenly became clear that my family member's bad temper was related to her being very ill. She got suddenly pale and had to lie down. She threw up. She seemed weak and in a bad way, and we didn't know what was wrong.

I think it wasn't long though before another of us got sick too. It was a disaster. We figured it was infectious, so tried not to infect each other, but it was a small place, with a sink being repeatedly vomited over.

Somehow at some point I came to be asleep. But I was woken up soon by a great urgency, and leapt from bed and to the bathroom. As well as feeling wretched, I felt like I would pass out — my visual field was turning black like it does briefly if you stand up too fast. Somehow I was taking half my clothes off. I was having terrible diarrhea, half naked, observed by my family and my friend, and I was losing consciousness, and we were in some stupid fucking fjord where it would take an hour for an ambulance to come, and probably everyone was too opinionated and wrong to even call one. Was I going to die because my holiday was so ridiculous? I think one of my companions was even annoyed with me before long, about some aspect of how I was handling the situation while dying incredibly embarrassingly. After some hollowly desperate staring at bathroom tiles, I regained more acceptable levels of nausea, sturdy-seeming consciousness, ...

Things actually got better from there, and while the holiday contained other episodes that were shockingly unpleasant, nothing so combined terror and abandoned humiliation.

(I returned to where the boy was, but this illness was apparently contagious for weeks after symptoms subsided, so he said he would wait on kissing me again, and we just went on walks together. Before the timer ran out though, he said he'd rather be friends. I cried for days. I was also sad for past me up in those mountains, thinking she could hold on to that one sweet thing.

Then we were friends for a year, then he did kiss me again, and this led to that, and now we've been dating for a year.)
