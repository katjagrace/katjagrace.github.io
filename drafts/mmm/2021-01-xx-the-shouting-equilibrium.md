The shouting equilibrium

- email contents, endlessly more emails
- task priority in todo list
- warning labels
- literal shouting in a noisy place (that is often just tragedy of the commons mixed with tree-race type thing, which I think is different?)
- standing up in the theater
- grade inflation?
- writing length (writer wants to emphasize things they think will be ignored, but then other stuff will be ignored, so they emphasize those too, not coming to terms with limited attention of reader)

there are arms races, or dollar auctions, or red queen races, or thing where everyone always just wants to be ahead of the opposition (races? not sure what the name is for such a simple thing. I'll call 'tree-race'). But in these cases, I think it is more specific - there is some prioritization that should get some things in and some not, and everyone thinks their thing should be higher in the prioritization than it actually should be, given the set of other things, so they give it a more attention grabbing label. This is against a backdrop of social norms where you can't just give it the most attention grabbing label maybe? Or there is an assumption that the people do actually mean well and are public spirited, but continually misjudge the thing in front of them.

In the situation of interest to me, it is like there are ten units of time to be allocated to things, and eleven units of thing that have someone thinking they should be included. So then lets say everyone picks a priority label to go on their thing, trying to guess accurately what it should be, then the doer does them in order of their numbers. In the simple case, everyone gives a label 0.1 points higher than their item should be, so then their thing gets done later than they thought was right. So next time, they recalibrate their scale of what flag translates to what priority, and give a slightly higher number. But since everyone does this, they still land in the same place, later than they wanted. So they do it again. Eventually everyone is giving numbers in the vicinity of 10. Your emails are all titled 'Important', your paragraphs all begin 'One more very important thing to remember...', your todo list is forever longer than you can possibly do, and possibly marked with things like 'NO REALLY DO THIS ONE'...

is there an opposite, where everyone thinks the thing they have is somewhat less important than it is, so makes it more quiet, and then nothing is said? Perhaps in an empty forum where everyone is arfaid to talk, though that seems to be because talking will make it take up all of the space

is this just the same as some known phenomenon? e.g. the standing up in the theater thing?
