Advanced AI might bring radical scientific progress, cure diseases, change the face of written content, abolish labor,
But none of this sounds like it would radically change the human experience. If we end death, I feel like that might radically change my life, but I know others don't feel the same way.

But a foreseeable technology that would more clearly transform the flavor of the human experience, or at least my experience, is when AI can write Hamilton-style musical numbers about my own life on command. I'm not kidding. I have such powerful emotions about aspects of Alexander Hamilton's life relative to those I have about almost anything in my own life, and I'm pretty into my life. And I don't think it's because his story involves more that is emotionally compelling (maybe it does, but I can compare to other emotionally compelling stories, and they are nothing to Lin Manuel). It's that Miranda is a fucking master, and crafts and shows to me the feelings, set to effortlessly enter my mind, alive.

  think such narration would bring all aspects of my life into focus emotionally, in a way that they are often not.

I just don't know how I would deal.

Imagine if every time you xxx

It would open the door to vivid emotional grasping of the stakes of everything. Maybe there are other technologies for that, but this is one that I can concretely imagine, whereas the other ones are some vague naive futuretech.

I think I have cried more about Hamilton than the ends of all my past relationships added together. I cried more the first time than about end of relationship. And I was like 'man, how would I even cope if someone wrote such a musical about the details of my own life, which you know, do have some advantage in being moving to me'
