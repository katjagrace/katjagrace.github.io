You shouldn't think stubbing your toe is more important than thousands of people dying in Africa.

Which seems obvious, but not very compelling to anyone's action.

Why not compelling?

Because it feels so important!

you can't care less about it

but caring too much about your toe isn't the error. your toe is just as important as it seems. It is the world that you are wrong about. The world is like your toe, but manyfold (five of them to a foot! feet scattered across hundreds of millions ?? of square kilometers, each pair felt/animated/put-out-there/inhabited/invested in/vested by a creature with hands too, and a mouth, and a tummy, and a chest, and some thoughts and hopes and cringing embarrassments and worries and dreams [so much more going on, and hurting, and mattering]). And that is what you don't really understand. (And if you did, it is just the sort of thing you do care about, because it is just like your toe. You are like a person with a numb hand cutting their fingers, or person who is forgetful making mistakes that will hurt them again tomorrow).
