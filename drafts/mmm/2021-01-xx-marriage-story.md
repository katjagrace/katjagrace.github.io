- I liked how it was the texture of their interactions and relationship, without being judgmental about it
- I liked how there were hints of love, or a dimension of love, through the kaleidoscope of discomfort and mundanity and cutting anger - he read out the letter saying she would always love him and cried, she cried looking at him, after he said that he wished she was dead he curled up on the floor and sobbed violently and she held him,
- neither person seems perfect or despicable or apparently despicable but renewed through some realization - both seem human and flawed and lovable and worthy and understandable and blind. She was seeming a bit bad I guess, but then she was so genuinely hurt about him fucking someone else, that it seemed more warm and understandable and not to be dismissed or pushed away.
- I liked the bit where he sang *Being Alive* in front of his theater friends
- The actors were all cast really well - the lawyers were all perfectly something. Especially the woman. I found her awful, but compelling and urging me to like her.  
- Seems like it makes me feel good about love, even though it was about a mostly unfriendly divorce
