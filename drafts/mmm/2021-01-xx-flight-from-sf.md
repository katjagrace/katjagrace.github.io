Dear Mother,
Last year at work we made predictions about whether I would flee San Francisco by the end of the year. Lots of people I knew went elsewhere during the year, or considered it, often citing considerations that seemed excessive to me - fear of covid, fear of civil unrest, fear of smoke. Just preferring a cheaper place during the social downtime makes sense to me, if you manage to correctly anticipate that it will be so long. But taking the smoke or possibility of riots as large factors in deciding what city to live in seemed more like taking into account that it is going to rain for the next two weeks. (At least without a dire breathing difficulty, or much higher assessment of the physical injuries of an hour of smoke than most people seem to have). These things might be annoying, but you turn on the air purifiers, or defer a few walks. If the sun just doesn't come up one day, that's surprising and admittedly troubling, but doesn't warrant a huge project to avoid. It was strange for me to be less worried about things than other people, because that's an experience I basically never have, except when the cause for concern is social shame.

Everyone thought I wouldn't flee, but I thought it three to five times harder. And indeed I stayed.

But a week ago, my housemate messaged us to say that she had a fever. We quarantined in our rooms for the week, before my boyfriend and I decided that we would rather quarantine somewhere nicer and less precariously close to other quarantiners, and our friends were kind enough to lend us a place to stay. So only two months into 2021, I have half-fled-half-holidayed from the city, an hour and a half down the coast. To a house in which the rolling roar of waves is everpresent, from whose armchair the sun can be watched setting over the Pacific.

I admit that this was probably also excessive, except in the sense that it is actively nice to go to beach houses sometimes, and this was a good time for it.

It was a psychologically difficult week in ways, and I arrived with little energy for anything except watching a particular reality TV show of a variety that does not reflect well on my tastes. So I was relieved today to find my virtue recovering. I got groceries and planned my week and
