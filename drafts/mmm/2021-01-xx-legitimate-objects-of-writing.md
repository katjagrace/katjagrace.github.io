When I was younger, and started a blog, I thought the only purpose of writing a thing was for it to be a novel propositionally true insight. I think my sense of embarrassment still thinks this, though I do not. So let us review some things that might be worth writing.

**Original writing conveying novel insightful propositions**

**Novel non-propositional head content** (e.g. thought-feelings, vibes, attitudes. Humans have lots of stuff in their heads, and its not obviously propositions, baby. Might be good to share some of the other stuff too, no?)
- this can often be relayed through writing about not especially insightful propositions from the way of being in question (related: [read insightful propositions from original authors to learn about non-propositional head-content lying next to insights](https://meteuphoric.com/2017/01/04/why-read-old-philosophy/))
- There might be a proposition corresponding to the head-content, e.g. it might give the reader a tempting picture of what it is like to be very driven, which could maybe also be spelled out as 'being very driven tends to involve having your attention steadfastly on the problem at hand, ...'. But the writer might not convey the proposition at all. They want to convey the other thing.

**Realization of insightful propositions**
- This is a subcategory of novel non-propositional head-content, but a key one
- This feels more personal than the novel ones. In conveying a novel idea, you are presenting it to the world at large. In presenting realization, it has its eye on the reader more, and how to fit the truth into the reader's mind.

**Novel non-insightful propositions**
- Sometimes its good to know things that aren't insights. For instance, details of detailed things which build into a picture that is together something like 'insightful', or fleeting current values of things that can take many values. xxx

**Novel re-communications of any of the above** (summaries, saying in different words, giving different examples, maybe connecting to different things? that might be minor new insight rather than recommunication)
- helpful for realization
- helpful for generalization
- helpful for different people getting things in different ways

**Non-novel raising awareness of either of the above**
- Links posts. Posts that just say 'here is a good thing: X'
- All the value to others of any of the above, at a small fraction of the cost. Bam.
