[It's a wonderful life spoilers]

I recently watched 'It's a wonderful life', for the second time.

I decided that it's my favorite movie. I'm not sure that you should take this as much evidence that you will like it.

- its great
- it has some flaws
- people say black and white movies no good, but seems as good as a modern movie by far
- I like when everyone shows up caring about him. There's a particular feeling to that, to do with how he had sort of forgotten about them all or was seeing himself as separate, and having his own problem to solve, and them all as sort of part of his problem, and then they all truly show up for him, lovingly.
- I like the idea of seeing what difference you made to the world
- I think the character who is overtly passionate about something else, but whenever there is an opportunity to do something that matters, that he isn't excited about, at his own expense, but which he knows is right, he drops his own thing without a thought. For his whole life. I guess it is generally more exciting when someone is virtuous in an unsung way, and I guess not being about virtue is a variety of that.
- Part of the moral seems to be that a lifetime of hometown good turns and wisdom, are nothing to sniff at, beside more glorified ambitions. I experience that moral warmly, but I wonder how it stands, empirically. And however it stands, I'm not sure quite how to interpret it into a story I can get behind.

Here are three options:

traditional ambitions = hometown good turns < ambition to do good
traditional ambitions = ambition to do good = hometown good turns
ambition to do good < traditional ambitions = hometown good turns

My boyfriend wonders about the well-formedness of the counterfactual world where George Bailey wasn't born. For instance, if he wasn't born, his brother probably wouldn't have been born either, let alone fallen in the ice and needed rescuing, or saved several ships of soldiers, because his parents would have moved differently before the conception of that child, and so got a different child, who would then be involved in a whole series of different childhood escapades, which probably wouldn't have involved the sledding in question, or if it did, there is no reason that a different child would also be the one to fall in the ice, and so on.

I'm not sure what the best counterfactual is here, but perhaps naively, feel like there must be one. One seemingly natural way to try to do such a reckoning without the chaotic effects would be to sum up what would happen at each point
