The other day I decided to try imbibing work-relevant blog posts via AI-generated recital, while scaling the Twin Peaks&mdash;large hills near my house in San Francisco, of the sort that one lives near and doesn't get around to going to. It was pretty strange, all around.

For one thing, I was wearing sunglasses. I realize this is a thing people do all the time. Maybe it's strange for them too, or maybe theirs aren't orange. Mine were, which really changed my experience of the world. For one thing, the glowing xxx world felt unreal, like cheap science fiction. But also, all kinds of beauty seemed to want photographing, but couldn't be seen with my camera. It was strange to realize that I'm surrounded by potential beauty all the time, that I would see if I had different eyes, or different glasses, or different sensory organs all together. Like, the potential for beauty is as real as the beauty I do see. (Of course, that is obviously true, but something being obviously true doesn't mean you know it. And knowing something doesn't mean you realize it. I'd say I knew it, but hadn't realized it.)

And then my ears were cornered in by these plugs spouting electronic declarations on the nature of coherent agents and such, which added to my sense of my head just not really being in the world, and instead being in a cozy little head cockpit, from which I could look out on the glowing alien world.

My feet were also strange, but in the opposite direction. I recently got these new sock-shoes and I was trying them out for the first time. They are like well-fitting socks with strong but pliable rubber stuff sprayed on the bottom. Wearing them, you can feel the ground under your feet, as if you were bare-foot. Minus the sharp bits actually lacerating your feet, or the squishy bits sullyingÂ them. Walking along I imagined my liberated feet were extra hands, holding the ground.

I had only been up to Twin Peaks twice before, and I guess I had missed somehow exactly how crazy the view was. It was like standing on a giant breast, with a city-sea-bridge-forest-scape panorama-ed around and under you over-realistically. The xxx bridge disappeared into xxxmystical mists and the supertankers swam epically on the vast blue xxxflat expanse.  I tried to photograph it multiple times but failed, partly because my camera couldn't capture the warm orange tinge of the sea and the bridge rising from the burned sunglass mists, and partly for whatever reason that things sometimes look very different in photographs, and partly because I am always vaguely embarrassed photographing things with people looking at me, and there was a steady smattering of people.



The roads had been blocked off to traffic during the pandemic. From a car I guess I don't realize what vast plateaus winding hillside roads are. For pedestrians, these were like some kind of

The people I saw going up were either flying down the swooping roads on bikes and skateboards, in a fashion that made me involuntarily imagine what I would do when they fell off, or flying unrealistically up the swooping roads on bikes, in a fashion that made me appreciate how good the best electric bikes must be now. I noticed as I watched one speed above me in awe that he sported the brand of his bourgeoisie bicycle on the back of his shirt, and wondered if he was just paid by them to ride up and down here all day, in the hope that someone would be so impressed that they would jot down the t-shirt label as the only clue to the rapidly disappearing bike's identity, then google it later).
