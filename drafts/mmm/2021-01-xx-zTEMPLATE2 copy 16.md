Joe and I are on holiday in the wine region of California.  Wines:

A) Lemony, fermentyness, light

B) Whale, with afterlemon. Whale is kind of numb, on the sides of tongue, but voluminous, then less anything, then more tangy.

C) Fine china, with warm velvet, with a frog of bitterness (green) going 'bleurgh' as frogs do. Neat velvet.

D) Joe does some kind of 'let it go through your whole experience, something something sound of voice, wine, ...' thing, katja: yes, taste is wide and voice is narrower and higher and sort of numb in the way that it doesn't touch your mouth, butter of buttermints toward the back of mouth

E) more velvet with afterlemon
