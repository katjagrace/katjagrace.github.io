Some observations about what is valuable:
1. Kissing my boyfriend feels good, which suggests something in the vicinity is valuable.
2. Such experiences present themselves as about something other than the feeling. For instance, it seems like the important thing is being with my boyfriend, and that the feeling is my response to the good thing. (This also describes evolution's presumed perspective on the situation.)
3. I also have a strong tendency to think that value springs somehow from conscious experience, and that if for instance we were both mindless philosophical zombies, or rocks, our making out would not be valuable (except perhaps to another observer).
4. These things seem to be in conflict: if the conscious experience itself is not what is valuable, but merely in response to what is valuable (2), then the thing of value would seem not to be especially tied to conscious experience. And presumably it would continue to be valuable even if the conscious feeling responding to it were to vanish. Yet a world empty of conscious experiences doesn't seem valuable (3).
5. It could be some complicated combination of these, where you need both the valuable thing, and the observer valuing it while being conscious, or something. But does that really seem likely, or does it seem like some some hopeless ad hoc attempt to avoid admitting that you should get into the experience machine?
5. Perhaps value does have to involve conscious experience, but it doesn't have to be the particular conscious experience that is responding to the value. In this case the good feeling is in response to being together, which is also conscious. Perhaps it is there that value and consciousness coincide.
6. [are there other cases where goodthing i snot conscious? doesn't this still seem kind of silly? maybe it is at a larger scale that vaule happens, where there is the good thing and the appreciating feelings, in the right relationship?]
