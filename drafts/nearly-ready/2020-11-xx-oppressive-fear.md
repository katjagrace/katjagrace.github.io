Once there was a holliwag, who lived in a small kipple on the pook, and each day walked along the okar crests to gather the brown turkleboks. The holliwag would look out over the pook as it walked, at the emms full of ochre light, and love it all. It was invigorated by the hunt for the brown turkleboks at the end, and having collected a whole tussik of them, carried them home each day in gleeful anticipation.

When travelers came by, the holliwag was most hospitable, offering them its spacious upstairs warum to stay a while. And this paid off one day, when a querimander came by, and accepted the offer. The querimander had an open and gentle face, and seemed wise and good, and spoke most interestingly. And soon the holliwag and the querimander found that they loved talking to one another more than anything else.

So naturally one day the holliwag invited the querimander to come along the okar crests and gather the brown turkleboks together. The querimander came gladly, but was quickly bemused.

"Why do you stay on the okar crests?" it asked. "Wouldn't it be quicker to cut across the okar valleys?"

The holliwag looked a little alarmed at the suggestion.

"I think it might be farchish down there&mdash;I don't want to risk it"

The querimander wasn't convinced, but didn't press the matter.

But shortly afterwards, it was puzzled again. "Why do you only look at the pook and the emms? Every time the path opens out onto the flavid, you hurry on or turn around looking for more emms. Are you scared of something?"

The holliwag hadn't been thinking about it, but had to admit that it did believe that looking at flavids could corrupt your vision.

The querimander was troubled. And now that it was paying attention, it noticed all sorts of oddities in the holliwag's behavior. The holliwag always walked around objects in its path to the right, even where that was a little hard to arrange. It never used its tail for grabbing things, even where it would obviously have helped. At the turkleboks, it quickly became clear that it was only gathering the brown turkleboks, and skipping the red spotted ones. The querimander asked about this, too, though it guessed what sort of reply it would get.

"Red spotted turkleboks can cause cankleburn, I read. And while it seems pretty unclear, I don't want to risk it." Again, the holliwag seemed flustered and upset, and the querimander wished it could do something.

"I'm worried for you, Holliwag", the querimander said at last. "You live your life in fear. You are oppressed on all sides, constrained in every action. So much of your attention is spent on avoiding the okar valleys, and the flavids, and the red spotted turkleboks. Seeing what it is like to live in your world here for a few hours, I feel so caged in! And you meet every new development with fear! Imagine what your life could be, if you weren't obsessed with these unimportant risks. You could focus on enjoying the ochre light on the flavids; you could really give yourself to the hunt for turkleboks. Poor Holliwag!"
