Here is a kind of problem I often have:

1. I am in a new situation. For instance, I am standing in the Californian wilderness, reaching to grasp a strange oily nut from the fruity pod of a strange oily nut tree.

2. I wonder whether certain actions in this new situation are so dangerous that I should avoid them. For instance, I wonder whether I should avoid getting the oil of the nut on my skin, or should avoid eating until I have washed my hands.

3. I try to answer these questions by estimating probabilities, though not necessarily explicitly. For instance, in the back of my mind at least, I ask myself, 'What is the chance that a random plant is poisonous? What is the chance that it is so poisonous that you shouldn't consume a lick of its juices? So poisonous that you shouldn't get its juices on your skin?'

4. I come up with some probabilities that are not extremely small. For instance, 1% that its poisonous, 0.1% that it is so poisonous that you shouldn't lick a bit, 0.01% that it is so poisonous that you should't get it on your skin. Maybe the real rates for plants are lower, but I am guessing on the fly and know very little about plants, so it is hard to be extremely confident. I do know that oleander trees are very poisonous and common in gardens, and about half of people don't seem to know that they are poisonous, so there isn't some argument like 'if it was dangerous I would have heard about it', or 'if it was dangerous, it wouldn't be allowed'.

5. I figure I should not do some things, where the probabilities of bad outcomes don't seem that small. For instance, I decide to play with the nut, but not eat until I wash my hands.

6. This kind of thing happens a lot, and is encumbering, and involves avoiding things that other people don't avoid, and seems overall bad.

7. (I try to look up the real frequencies later, and the internet makes the problem worse. For instance, it doesn't really cover that topic, but does offer lists of plants more intensely poisonous than I thought plausible, as well as vivid anecdotes of people dying from plant encounters.)

Many other people seem to not have this problem, for reasons that are opaque to me, and I think often to them. Their methods of decision-making without having such problems seem to centrally involve not thinking about the issue, not estimating probabilities, and not looking on the internet. At a high level, they call their methods 'not having an anxiety disorder', but at the more detailed epistemological level, I'm not sure what the process looks like. For instance, how do they distinguish between things that are dangerous and those that are not? Can it be described in more Bayesian terms? Or terms that make sense in some framework that I understand?

(I don't actually know if other people would take precautions regarding the oily nut&mdash;part of the point is that it isn't clear to me how to tell apart the cases where they would and where they wouldn't.)xxx

My current best guess is that people mostly judge intuitively whether taking precautions seems like the normal thing to do socially, and lean on society for having roughly the right behavioral patterns around potentially dangerous things. For instance, I predict lots of people would play with a nut that they found, and would worry if it started burning their skin or something, and would wipe their hands on their pants if their hands actively felt oily, and they wanted to use them for eating. So my theory is that if I didn't have an anxiety disorder, I would also behave like that, having predicted that that is how people normally behave.

Is that what you do? What do you do?
