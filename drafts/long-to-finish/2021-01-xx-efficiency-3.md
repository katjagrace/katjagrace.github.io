It's not clear to me how often pursuing efficiency actively does worse than not trying to optimize the situation


I also wonder, is the claim that it is , what's the better alternative? Not trying? Surely efficiency is better than that? But I guess it is often better, but loses things, and then the people who liked those things are sad

is having goals bad? lw commenter notes that efficiency is opposed to slack, and slack is green re mtg color wheel, which sounded initially silly to me (why not add slack as a value?) but connection with green makes me think of CS Lewis and Anna and how maybe it isn't good to come into the world with goals, rather than seeing what there is. But does that make any sense? If you see what there is, you implicitly have goals. But maybe in practice it is different. You don't have a vision in mind and set out to bring it about, because you don't yet know what it is. You look at what there is in the world, and maybe then come up with a vision? I guess I was conflating not knowing what is good when you are born with incremental adjustment.

this makes me think about how apparently you just can't be a goal-directed agent, in that you must have a bounded utility function. Or so Paul said, I think. What are the implications of that for making agents?
