A question that I return to in life strategy is whether to 'spend one's weirdness points wisely'&mdash;that is, to cower lonely behind a cardboard cutout of the most forgettable person while proffering optimized propaganda through a carefully selected hole&mdash;or whether to offer the world a clearer view of oneself.

This is related to conflict theory vs. error theory

It is better for the epistemic economy of the world to have full views of people

The arguments as I see them:
- If you

This blog is intended to manifest my tentative answer.

[^1] I'm not sure whether 'genuine self' makes sense as a concept, but I think the question does anyway.

The information economy

- An important thing in the world, that we don't have good ways of thinking about, is the dynamics of information flow and reasoning in society. The 'information economy', but I think we don't have such good concepts for what is happening as we do for the object and substance economies. (But they interact, so to the extent that we don't have a full picture of the information one, we are also missing things about the other one perhaps - e.g. people buy things because they have ideas about things). We have models of memetics, and maybe other bits, but I don't at least have a big picture picture of what is basically going on. I guess there are individuals who want to know 'what is going on' (which is a complicated one, because it does not mean, 'what affects them'). They also want entertainment, relatedly. Who actually appears to buy information? Can we look at all the big flows apparently of it, and ask why they are happeneing and what they are like and build a picture?
