My house watched *Moana* recently, satisfying an increasingly urgent sense that we should get organized and watch *Moana* one of these days, while also possibly distracting some people from worrying about the election.

(I for one was not worried at all about the election, in a surprising inversion of roles. I cared about the outcome, and was curious for developments, but *worry* seems to flow more naturally from internal conflict about doing something about a problem, and at present I feel good about my lack of doing anything, though I suppose attempting to intervene would be more of a baller move at this point.)

By way of review, I will propose a theory of spirituality consistent with *Moana*, and then apply it to our current circumstances.

My housemates thought the high level plot of *Moana* was basically a metaphor for global warming and other bad natural things happening as a result of cocky human attempts to mess with nature, before some hero xxx power to nature, before continuing to lead a happy sustainable islander lifestyle. This moral conflict dosen't feel compelling, because as far as it is represented in such places it seems hollow - a recognizable stereotypical story that people often have about what other people might be saying, but doesn't xxxcome with any meaningful filling on its own. Why is it bad to change nature? In this world, it would seem to be that doing so causes a black pestilance to spread across all surfaces in the world, but what is that saying about our world? What are the meta-ethics? It seems to be just kind of naturally bad randomly, like you could also imagine a world where blue objects were bad. By what mechanism does it get punished? What am I, as a person living in the real world, meant to take away from this?

I think Moana is fundamentally about spirituality as contact with the world.xxx[not sure, trying it out]

xxx[a kind of nature worship that gels with this and explains the balance etc things would be something like nature moves toward the kinds of organization that are alive and good—toward life, cooperation, consciousness, understanding- and so it isn't that anything that exists, or that anything that shows up in an 'ecosystem' is good - many such things are contrary to these self-organizing patterns of goodness. So it isn't nature per se, and it isn't everything, that is good in the vicinity of naturalness-to-be-worshipped. [e.g. to the extent a rabbit is a self organizing conscious system, and a fox is, they are both precious in this way, and at a high level the playing out of their populations may be too, but if the fox were to eat the rabbit, that would just disrupt the rabbit system to a place of unrecoverable lack of the sacred things. It would be as bad as me killing the rabbit, and worse than me sending the rabbit to space, regardless of what is 'natural'.] Whatever happens isn't balanced. Death isn't balanced. But what we think of as 'nature' is heavily involved with the flourishing of these patterns. And they tend to involve negative feedback mechanisms, concretely. i.e. 'balance'. ]

Central to all of these patterns is being touched by things and internalizing it. Which can be simple and mundane—a thermostat is touched by the air and adjusts its insides accordingly.

That is, learning from your past. Where you are now is based on course adjustments you have been making along the way.

Not being blind and numb

I hear *Moana* as saying that orienting yourself in the world is important to the point of spirituality. You should know who and where you are. In particular, you should remember where you came from, and understand what you have seen and been touched by. From all that, how to move next will flow clearly. All that gives you a place of solidness/confidence to spring from. You might be floating in an empty and uncertain ocean, but if you locate yourself, you can move with force and certaintyxxx[not-of-two-mindness?]. Not knowing these things leaves you confused and

Literally sailing on the ocean is a great metaphor, because if you don't know your past and can't see things, if you are blind and numb and memoriless, you are hopelessly floating in a vast indistinguishable expanse. If you manage to contact enough things with your mind, then you can literally leverage your physical body to where you want it.
