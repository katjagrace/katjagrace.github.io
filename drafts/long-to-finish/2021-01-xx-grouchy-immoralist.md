What about the case where Bob is in charge of giving out vaccines, and he enjoys it because he enjoys sticking needles in people, and seeing them wince. Can this persist in utopia?

It seems like it isn't bad for the other person, because they are getting the vaccine.

It isn't bad for Bob's values, because he is an asshole.

But maybe it is somehow bad for him to be an asshole? Bad for the world to have an asshole in it instead of a kind person, doing it out of love?

if you kill a child to have all kinds of wonders, then there is a sense that the morally correct stance for someone in the city might be to be properly somber about the killing, and that if they do that, then they won't enjoy the wonders. So the non-consequentialist thing going on here is the moral correctness of certain attitudes of the citizens, similar to in the above.

Could be that the high level principle doesn't sound right, but that the low level examples do, and why is that wrong?

Maybe the high level thing's correctness is understood as you come to appreciate properly how it cashes out in the object-leveel things. Becasue in some sense theey are the one object. Like, if you like each bite of strawberry, but don't find the prospect of 'strawberries' compeelling, it would be that strange to just come to appreciate that all the strawberry biting is what strawberriees are.

Joe talks about xxxperson's view that you should have the ehigh level principle that fits the cases, and then also the high level principle should be good. But why that game in particular, with all these intuitions? Why do they need a high level principle even? I don't have a high level principle for what foods to likeâ€”why do I need one for morality?

I propose an alternative game, which has the benefit of also being how things should go with everything, e.g. which foods I like. It goes like this:

1. You find yourself in the world with a collection of intuitions. At first it is very small, but the set produces further intuitions over time in conjunction with your observations. Intuitions include things like 'things I see are in front of me' and '2 + 1 is 3' and 'being hit is bad'. They have different strengths
