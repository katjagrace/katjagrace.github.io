Today I mopped the garage floor, after a fluorescent tube shattered upon it. Fluorescent lights have some mercury in them, so there was some potential question of mercury poisoning risk. This made me interested in the question of how people generally come to (rightly?) trust that putting up CFLs is safe, or what our overall system for this is. My impression is that some official body checks that things are safe, and if they are deemed not safe, then you aren't allowed to make or sell them. Now that I say it aloud, I'm not sure if this is even how it works. And if it does, are these people good at checking if things are safe? I find figuring out whether things are safe extremely hard, and are they in a much better position?

While considering mopping the area with an alcohol-containing product, I remembered that [diethyl-mercury is the most absurdly poisonous thing I have heard of] and wondered whether mixing ethyl and alcohol might somehow invite this kind of thing.





- looking into this a bit, I don't find much - maybe it is that you can just be sued? But then there are so many things where it would be hard to tell if you didn't do a study or something
- it didn't seem like the world had good info on how safe it was, before. Seems like a few years ago, there was also (EPA?) advice around suggesting that you should get a cleanup crew in if you break a light globe, until someone actually did this, and they had to rethink it. So I guess nobody is following the rules? Why is it so crazy harsh with the FDA and so lax with other things, if so?
- does someone have to go through the different chemical reactions a thing could undergo with any other thing that might be around, and rule them out?

When I looked this up a few years ago,
