I recently watched the film *Dazed and Confused*, Richard Linklater's window on the last day of school for various high school students in the 1970s.xxx It changes focus between around ten characters, without a clear lead, and with various variously resolved plotlines. One of the most central characters is xxx, a boy finishing middle school who is harshly

My impression is that it is often taken as a kind of jubilant celebration of the high spirited rollercoaster of that age, and that time.

To me 'jubilant' seems too positive and ascribing of orientation to the characters.

 it seemed darker, but without seeming so to the non-self-aware characters. The characters were indeed partaking in an emotional ride, but hadn't had a non-socially-desperate moment alone to wake up as moral agents, so their actions were amoral and watching them was like watching a fire. They were in an endless stream of uncomfortable social situations where they were compelled by desperation to act to save face.

xxx drives with the older kids, all smoking weed, and they start grabbing trash cans through the window and emptying them down the street, before destroying a mailbox with each can. They laugh raucously. At first xxx smiles uncertainly, then his turn comes and he throws a bowling ball through the window of a car. There is a nervous moment, then they

Was compelling, but didn't seem to enrich my life. Can believe that it is very accurate, but creatures portrayed are empty, pustules of social desperation licked along in the currents of social forces.


I'm not sure what Linklater intended.

It received a lot of praise, including being the funniest xxx. I couldn't even tell if it was meant to be humorous. I mean, people say things that are humorous, and they didn't fall flat, but people say humorous things in life too, and these were probably less funny than that.
