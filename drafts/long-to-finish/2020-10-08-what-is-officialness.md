Officialness seems to play an extensive role in human behavior, such that the economy and policy might be better understood with a theory of it. But what is it?

Some stylized facts:
- People don't haggle in US supermarkets
- I feel like the supermarket is the boss
- Public institutions, i.e. everything agreed by the government to be part of the government, are official. If I made a new department of transport, it would not be official.
- People distinguish between large companies with an air of authority, and 'random people' or small companies with a less authoritative air
- if a company says something, it is presumed to be true
- A book can be 'authoritative'. Which means it seems to be true and extensive, but is also trustworthy and has some relationship with the reader where the reader should in fact trust them.
- 'Officials' are often government employees with some official-as-in-according-to-the-rules permission to tell others what to do. They can also be contest officials. It would be weird if they were Myer officials, and would suggest Myer was trying to have more authority than it is considered to, i.e. to be considered more correct and in charge.
- there is an 'official' answer to various questions, an 'official story', 'official truths'
- people hang on to and talk in terms of the 'official story' even when they on reflection could hardly believe it (e.g. school is for learning) [is this true?]
- 'authoritative' means a mixture of 'expert' and 'the boss of what's true and what you should do about it'
- people say 'it's official'. They seem to do this roughly when a thing that some subset of people believed was true becomes acknowledged as true according to the 'official' rules or an 'official' judge.
- You can't just say there are different rules, to a contest say. Even if say you are the funder of the prizes. Or if you announce that there are different rules, people would wonder what the 'official' rules are, and maybe say that the other ones are the official rules, but you have said you will pay out under different rules.
- There are official contests, and unofficial contests.
- Things are 'unofficial' when they are
- There is a presumption that the official story is to be trusted, out in the open. If you disagree with the official story, that is subversive
- The officialness of the government feels like something beyond their being the most socially powerful group. As if they have some magical halo of adultness and common-good interest and are standing on a metaphysical pedestal of right power that we just found in the world. When they behave totally at odds with that, it is somehow hard to accept, and it seems like there is just a temporary aberration in which the xxx of official government has been invaded by some  
- When I try to say something about officialness, it often involves more of the word 'official' in the explanation. e.g. 'The official winner is the person the official judges say won', or 'the officially correct way to xxx'
- You can seem more official by writing in a non-flowery encyclopedic style, avoiding personal
- Official things are somehow impersonal
- It is tempting to try to seem official.
- 'Authority'

Officialness seems related to a shared-among-humans set of beliefs, and to social power, and to rules, and to trust.
