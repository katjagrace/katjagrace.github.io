For instance, [small costs spread over huge numbers of people](https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/), investing in important science with huge urgency (e.g. longevity), creating people, sentient algorithms, the importance of looking out for such moral catastrophes itself.

...where a philosophical argument leads to a surprising conclusion that we end up not taking seriously, or treating as a reductio ad absurdum.
