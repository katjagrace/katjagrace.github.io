There is some notion kicking around that if 'the system' clearly fails and is evidently corrupt, then the time has come to overthrow it and start again.

I really don't follow this reasoning. It's like believing that your car is ideal, and giving it a second chance with a strange rattle or a funny smell, but when you learn that its break pads are definitely worn through, running it off the road.

An interesting piece by Michael Huemer on Facebook today reminded me

I get the urge—if sorting out your bookshelf isn't going well—to just throw all the books on the floor and start again. But I don't think that's an apt analogy. The apt analogy is setting  fire to your bedroom because the

I agree that there are circumstances where it makes sense to 'overthrow the system'

'It's not that lawless anarchy is better than the current system—it's just a stepping stone to building something great'

'I know that's what you're saying, but it just seems like an insane stone to try to step on if you are trying to get somewhere good.

I hear people as saying that when acting within the system has failed (like once, but when it should have succeeded), then it has been shown to be truly defective, and then it is time to overthrow it. Rather than, assuming that of course it is truly defective, and thinking one should work to improve it, including overthrowing it if that's going to be the most effective way to make it less defective, but that seems unlikely, what with all the ways that don't involve trashing everything good, risking your life, and ending up in a lawless hellhole.
