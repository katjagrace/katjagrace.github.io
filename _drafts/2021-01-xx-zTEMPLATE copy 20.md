When I have a lot of things to do, and little native urge to do them, I often arrange them into a kind of game for myself. The nature and appeal of this game has been relatively stable for about a year, after a long evolution, so this seems like a good time to share it.

The basic idea is to lay out the tasks in time like obstacles in a platformer or steps in game like

Here's how to play:
2. Take some drawing surface and make a grid with as many rows as there are remaining hours in your hoped for productive day, and ~3 columns. Each box stands for a particular ~20 minute period (I sometimes play with 15 or 30m periods.)
1. Lay out the gameboard: break the stuff you want to do into appropriate units. A unit should fit comfortably in the length of a block, and it should be easy enough to verify the done-ness of. (This can be achieved through house rules such as 'do x a tiny bit = do it until I have a sense that an appropriate tiny bit has been done'). Space things out a decent amount so that the thing is reasonably feasible. Add nice or relaxing things, or break activities. Drinks, snacks, pushups, looking at news sites for 5 minutes, etc.
3. Break up things

A basic problem with working on a big pile of things in a big expanse of time is that if you work or not during any particular minute, it feels like it makes nearly no difference to the chance of success.xxx[untrue? isn't it in some sense the same as one task per minute? how is it actually different] If I don't work this minute, I only need to work a smidgen faster on average to get all the things done, and it's unlikely that my other efforts will get me exactly to the line where this minute pushed me over&mdash;probably I will either succeed with hours to spare (haha) or fail hours from my goals. On the other hand, the pleasure of not working this specific minute is distinctly, tangibly higher than the pleasure of working. So my felt sense of value often favors not working, even if a more rational accounting would disagree.

Much more compelling is a single specific thing one must do within minutes. The task and the time are lined up so that actions right now matter. Slacking this minute is the difference between success and failure. It feels different to have one email to respond to in the next three minutes and to have a thousand emails to deal with in the next fifty hours.

One might naively respond to this issue by breaking up one's tasks into few-minute chunks, then laying them out in a day of tiny time boxes, then aiming for each to happen by the end of its allotment. But this will be terrible. A few boxes in, either you'll be ahead or behind. And either way, your immediate actions have drifted away from mattering&mdash;if behind, you are back to hoping that maybe if you work a bit harder now, you'll catch up and get some tasks done in their time boxes later in the day. If ahead, the pressure is off: you'll probably succeed at the next increment whether or not you work hard now.

So the basic idea of this game is to meet tasks one at a time where each one matters in its moment, like Beat Saber say, but for the game to adjust the slack to keep the next moment's action important all day.

A thing I like about this is that it actually makes the activity more genuinely fun and compelling. Often 'productivity hacks' seem to be about somehow tricking yourself, or forcing yourself to do something that you have real reason to dislike. Whereas I think humans are just genuinely better at being in an enjoyable flow state when their activities have certain structures that are genuinely compatible with the things they need to get done. Beat saber arguably wouldn't be fun if all the boxes were just sitting in a giant pile and you had to beat your way through as many as you could. But it is fun. The same thing that makes Beat Saber more fun than Saber-a-bunch-of-boxes-whenever can genuinely also be applied to tasks.


In spite of some pessimism about 'productivity hacks' in general.
