When I have a lot of things to do, and little native urge to do them, I often arrange them into a kind of game for myself. The nature and appeal of this game has been relatively stable for about a year, after a long evolution, so this seems like a good time to share it.

A basic problem with working on a big pile of things in a big expanse of time is that if you work or not during any particular minute, it makes nearly no difference to the chance of success.xxx[untrue? isn't it in some sense the same as one task per minute? how is it actually different] If I don't work this minute, I only need to work a smidgen faster on average to get all the things done, and whatever I end up doing the rest of the day, it's highly unlikely that my other efforts will get me exactly to the line where this minute pushed me over&mdash;probably I will either succeed with hours to spare (haha) or end the day far from my goals. On the other hand, the pleasure of not working this specific minute is distinctly, tangibly, higher than the pleasure of working. So my felt sense of value often favors not working.

Much more compelling is a single specific thing one must do within minutes. The task and the time are lined up so that my actions right now matter. Having one email to respond to in the next three minutes feels different to having a thousand emails to deal with in the next fifty hours.

One might naively respond to this issue by breaking up one's tasks into few-minute chunks, then laying them out over a day of tiny time boxes, and aiming for each to happen by the end of its allotment. But this will be terrible. A few boxes in, either you are ahead or behind. And either way, your immediate actions are drifting away from mattering again&mdash;if behind, you are back to hoping that maybe if you work a bit harder now, you will catch up later in the day. If ahead, the pressure is off: you'll probably succeed at the next increment whether or not you work hard now.

This game is like xxx, but which adjusts the slack to keep the next moment of high importance all day.

The basic idea is to lay out the tasks in time like obstacles in a platformer or steps in game like

Here's how to play:
2. Take some drawing surface and make a grid with as many rows as there are remaining hours in your hoped for productive day, and ~3 columns. Each box stands for a particular ~20 minute period (I sometimes play with 15 or 30m periods.)
1. Lay out the gameboard: break the stuff you want to do into appropriate units. A unit should fit comfortably in the length of a block, and it should be easy enough to verify the done-ness of. (This can be achieved through house rules such as 'do x a tiny bit = do it until I have a sense that an appropriate tiny bit has been done'). Space things out a decent amount so that the thing is reasonably feasible. Add nice or relaxing things, or break activities. Drinks, snacks, pushups, looking at news sites for 5 minutes, etc.
3. Break up things

In spite of some pessimism about 'productivity hacks' in general.
