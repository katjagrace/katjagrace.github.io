*A self-indulgent account of my current retreat, in case you want to know what it's like being a different person to you, and so that I remember this better in future.*

I'm on an end-of-year retreat, my fifth in a row. It feels wrong to write for outside eyes here&mdash;a crack in the pretensexxx that these cozy rooms and the rain outside are the world, and observers and obligations exist only on some irrelevant other plane, for these three days. But this year it's mostly a writing retreat, so I shall suck it up.

Another reason to suck it up is that this is a somewhat spiritual retreat, and even small doses of spirituality awake in me an urge to become scrupulous and neurotic. As soon as the meditation starts, I get twitchy. My thoughts become encumbered by an encompassing sense that I should be moving and thinking in certain ways, not quite known, not natural. And 'rules' like 'no writing public things about this' suggest themselves a lot. 

And descents into neurosis such as these should not be borne! (In general, if one has the energy to not bear them, if one is me.) Let them in and they will settle in and grow. 

I also doubt these neuroses help in any way: I don't really know what spirituality is, but my guess is that its better parts are better reached through being embodied and free and happy and accepting and perceptive, not through intellectual rule following, pious pedantry, tight-jawed seriousness, judgmentalness, and constraints on thought. That said, I don't seem to be the only one who gets pulled toward the latter in the vicinity of religion.

Traditionally, end of year retreat involves:
1. meditation
2. vaguely thematically retreaty things&mdash;like if you didn't know what retreating was for, but wanted to cargo cult it: candles, listening to Christian monks opine on life, getting up early, abjuring habitual addictions, eating lentils.
3. spirituality (you know, the atheistic kind.. no I don't know either, but here we are)
4. reflecting on the year
5. attempted self improvement, roughly CFAR style
6. attempts at 'living in reality' and 'being a baller', which in my internal ontology are the same, and substantially overlapping with 'spirituality': try to perceive the world as it is, and feel it, and come to terms with it, and don't be tied up in knots trying to act in it; be able to wield yourself well...

An issue with all this, is that I can't presently remember why some of it seemed good, and I'm not really in the mood, given that. I have definitely been excited about something in the vicinity of meditation and spirituality before. But sitting down to meditate right now, I want it to be over. So I could just not do it, but if I skip it all, perhaps I won't ever remember again what was good about it. And from inside when it seemed good, I think it maybe seemed so good that everything without it seemed like error.

So I'm compromising by making this a writing retreat, but with an eye to all the rest (e.g. maybe I will blog about what I think is up with spirituality, or how to live in reality and be a baller), and with mornings before I start writing dedicated to more retreatish rituals. 

I'm hoping that that such morning things get me into a better headspace for writing, but today I'd say it didn't work. Or perhaps the absence of my usual unwholesome anxiety reduction techniques is just a stronger pressure away from being in a good headspace. In the last hour I've been so dazed I can hardly think at times, which is probably because I took xanax, which was to hold off a combination of anxiety and probably-stress-induced-migraine. Usually I might now obsessively look at Manifold Markets or play a gripping phone game, which would spark my mind into coherence. But instead I am stuck in this vague purgatory. I took a second dose of adderall, so we'll see. 

If things go well at some point though, I'm hoping that if I write a blog post about it, anything important I learn will actually be available to me in the future, in spite of the spottiness of my memory on such topics.

Today I remembered that pacing around is pretty good. I think I learn this every time I have a retreat, and often in between, and mostly fail to propagate it into my normal life, except when I'm really anxious and it comes naturally. Today I paced back and forth in the hallway listening to Sam Harris explain why he thinks the 'meaning of life' isn't a good question. I'm generally sympathetic to it being a bad question, but I tend to think that if someone sees merit in something, and someone else doesn't, the former person is probably right in some important way. Like, if people keep wondering about the meaning of life, there's something that's grabbing them. And it's going to be more enlightening to figure out what it is or why they hunger for it than to explan why it doesn't make sense on your model. (Or maybe it's just that I personally have mostly loudly explained my own disinterest too much historically, and other people should heed different advice.)

I also finished reading Ben Kuhn's ['Staring into the abyss as a core life skill'](https://www.benkuhn.net/abyss/), and thought about which important questions in life I might particularly hate to think about. I didn't actually think about them much, I just wrote them down. I figure noticing them at all probably goes a long way, and it seems best not to be disincentivised from coming up with such things by immediately being forced to suffer them.

I spent more than twelve hours on blogging, staying up late because I was into it (and maybe a bit because I needed to urgently un-publish a bunch of drafts that Substack randomly posted in the process of importing Worldly Positions)xxx. Incidentally, this is more than I often work in a week.

The next day,
- generally a bit dizzy, a bit constrained in my mind like i can't stand back and see everything at once metaphorically or remember what I'm missing
- It's bad somehow that the lights in my room can't be brighter. Like, sometimes I just want a bright light in my face, for sanity. In general, I'm getting the impression that I usually do things to modulate what my mind is like, and they are substantially off-limits now due to being addictive internet things or broadly unwholesome. Or else perhaps some of them being off-limits disorients me in my usually sub-conscious dance of being mentally alright, and so I don't know what to do, even though there are still things I could do, and I end up mentally less alright. But I often end up mentally less alright anyway, so maybe this is just more of the usual. It's cope-with-able, but I do hunger for some vision of mental clarity and poise that I (falsely?) imagine comes from just really being able to look at whatever one wants on the internet at any moment. 
- Joe is feeling sick, so we are worried about covid, so I have retreated to my room. My feelings aren't so worried though. And I opened the window for ventilation, which means there is a lot of 'redwoods in thick rain' vibe coming in, which is pretty good. I packed a fuckton of supplements one should maybe take if one has covidxxx and a mask one might think is overkill for a two person retreat in the forest, so am terrifically prepared. I doled out some supplements for myself and gave the rest to Joe, and wear my mask in common areas, and feel like I'm doing okay. It might be tricky to get paxlovid if need be, but we'll figure it out. Much of our communication about this has happened via little hand-written notes, because it is a silent retreat. We relented and talked a bit, mostly in whispers, and I resisted the temptation to say anything unnecessary about the miracle of how I was actually reading his blog post.

For today's reading/listening time, I'm reading Joe's sincerity post

At some point, a kind of feeling came over me, which was familiar, but I wasn't sure I'd named. A rising pitch of mental tightness and hardness. The warmth draining out. The OCD knob suddenly turned up. The end of easy reading time. I guess perhaps it's the feeling I sometimes get at the end of the day if I worked hard and took adderall. (I've never been sure if the adderall directly causes that, or if it causes the working hard, which causes the mental state.) It's as if while my head was down working, something was gathering out of view, and when I see it, it has grown too overpowering to wind down again. A big problem is that it makes me twitchy&mdash;like a person with Tourette's or a stammer, at worst it can become hard to move or speak for all the OCD-required flinches that present themselves. Why do I do them? I don't really know. It feels like it will be terrible if I don't. Why do you flinch when a ball comes toward your face, if you know it's held back by a string? It doesn't feel like I will be physically hurt though, it feels like my soul will be broken into by forces of darkness, my self will be disintegrated, the future will be sickening and incoherent. I'm not sure how well this behavior can be described by rational agency, versus being barely-amenable-to-willpower and justified after the fact, but perhaps I'm just trying to let myself off the hook. I have let the OCD tormentors have my soul before, and at least one time I instanly got better for a while. But it creeps back, and at any given moment confronting it all right then seems likely to be a whole thing, so I conveniently justify putting it off for years. But actually until writing this paragraph I hadn't thought so much about it explicitly in a while. Probably I should do something.

At any rate, right now the OCD knob is only turned up a little. But reading went from a delicious smorgasbord of thoughts to repeatedly running my eyes over black and white words, effortfully wresting meaning from them.

Something about this particular reading experience reminds me of doing projects&mdash;there is energy at the start, and then it runs out and perhaps every motion becomes strained. But an important part I realize now is that the energy is coming from the whole thing fitting in my mind well, as if there is an era of coherence, where some object builds up in my mind, and every corner of it is seen, and I can deftly manipulate it, and we are dancing together. But then if that episode ends&mdash;because I have to sleep, or my attention is grabbed by something else, or it's just too big, or I become twitchy&mdash;then I can't easily pick the thing up again next time, and squish it back into my mind. I could by starting again at the start perhaps, but perhaps not even, and that's not so helpful. I don't know if this account is right, but I think there's something right about it.

We may have departed substantially from the retreat aesthetic. Now I'm eating ferrero rochers for lunch in my bed at 4pm while I vaguely look at my computer screen. My computer screen is less satisfying than usual, so hopefully that counts for something.
